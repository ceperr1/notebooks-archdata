The PAS records finds discovered by the public, outside of excavation, in England and Wales. The data available on the database can be accessed by anyone, but exact findspots are only available to credentialed researchers. The current data consist of almost 1.5 million objects that often contain visual media in the form of photographs, illustrations, or 3D models, as well as linked data. This model of public–professional collaboration, coupled with an open access dissemination strategy, has proven productive. The PAS lists close to 150 PhD dissertations that have used their data, as well as over 700 total research projects. \n\nYou've already used Python to connect to the Open Context API, but here we'll use R and try to retrieve data using the PAS API. Since you've already go through the process with using an API, try to notice any similarities or differences between using Python and R. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1.

BC 2350 - c. BC 2050).&amp;nbsp;\nThe axe is broadly rectangular in plan with a slightly splayed crescentric blade. In profile and in section the object is broadly lentoid.\nThe sides of the axe gently taper outwards with a shallow curve, from the rounded butt to the blade. The curve is less shallow towards the blade. The axehead has suffered significant loss from corrosion on all surfaces, particularly at the blade and the butt.\nThe axehead measures 67.4 mm in length, the butt is 18.1 mm wide and the blade measures 27.3 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 3.8 mm, the ridge measures 10.9 mm thick and the blade is 2.1 mm thick. The axehead weighs 59 g.\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham&amp;#39;s (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL.&amp;nbsp;BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\nReference:\n\nNeedham, S.

Soil remains wedged between layers. The object has been folded up and consists of 5-6 layers. The tapering tip of one end of the strip is visible on the outside of the folded bundle. Lines of pointillé decoration run along both edges of the strip and meet at the terminal. There are three perforations visible on a terminal of the band that tapers inwards forming a triangle with the single perforation at the tip of the taper en\n\nDimensions (in folded condition):\n\nLength: 28.23mm\nWidth: 19.93mm\nThickness (with soil): 5.33mm\n\nThickness (sheet): 0.18mm\nWeight (with soil): 8.55g\n\nMetal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the strip (undertaken at the British Museum) indicated a surface composition of approximately 92-94% gold and 6-8% silver, the rest (less than 1%) being copper. (See appended report).\n\nCurators note: this is a very similar composition to the very similar band from Berinsfield, South Oxfordshire (Treasure case 2016 T521).\n\nDiscussion: Of Early Bronze Age date (c.2500 - 1500 BC), and now in two pieces, this is only the fifth or sixth example of this type of object from Britain. These objects are rare and are not yet fully understood; it is likely to date from the earliest Bronze Age / Chacolithic period, c. 2500-2200 BC and as such is part of a select group of objects that represent the earliest gold objects in Britain.\n\nThe function or what object this mount decorated is not certain; suggestions include scabbard fittings, diadem or neck choker/band, or perhaps a decorative strip attached to leather. A similar object was reported as Treasure in 2005, case number 2005T21 (from 'near Winchester' - the provenance is vague - acquired by the British Museum: 2008, 8019.1) (Needham &amp;amp; Sheridan 2014, 908-9). The 'near Winchester' find also has three perforations set within the terminals in a similar fashion to a recently reported item from Stratford-Upon-Avon (Treasure case 2016 T209), and Berinsfield, South Oxfordshire (Treasure case 2016 T521).

</span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>FLAT AXEHEAD   </span></td><td>BRONZE AGE</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Incomplete cast copper alloy miniature flat axehead, sub-triangular in plan, and slightly lozenge-shaped in profile, with an undeveloped, straight-sided blade that has worn to a curve on one side. From the blade the axe tapers to a narrow rounded butt end, that is 14 mm wide. The sides of the blade expand slightly and meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 27 mm. The curve of the blade suggests that it was not probably used as an axehead but instead perhaps buried as a representation of a larger functional axehead at a time when bronze was too valuable to bury. The length of the flat axe is only 76 mm so it less than half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.\n\nSee CORN-7ACDD7 for a similar miniature flat axehead that is dated from 2200-2000 BC.\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axehead on page 502, plate 69, no.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, which is associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.\n\nCowie &amp;amp; O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin &amp;amp; Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axehead with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.\n\nSchmidt &amp;amp; Burgess (1981) illustrate similar unclassified miniature flat axeheads with worn blades in pl.22, nos.266 &amp;amp; 283.\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\nNeedham, S.

</span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>FLAT AXEHEAD   </span></td><td>BRONZE AGE</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).\n\nThe flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with an incomplete rounded shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 12.0 mm (thickness: 2.4 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. The axe is thickest at the mid point (6.0 mm), with no sign of a proto stop ridge. The sides of the blade expand to produce a rounded blade edge with an abraded width of 34.4 mm (thickness 3.6 mm). \n\nThe axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\nIt measures 72.5 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 34.4 mm, width at the butt is 12.0 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 6.0 mm. It weighs 48.6 grams.\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\nReference:\n\nNeedham, S.

From the blade the axe tapers to a narrow rounded butt end, that is 14 mm wide. The sides of the blade do not expand but meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 29 mm. The curve of the blade suggests that it was not probably used as an axehead but instead perhaps buried as a representation of a larger functional axehead at a time when bronze was too valuable to bury. The length of the flat axe is only 83 mm so it less than half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.\n\nSee CORN-7ACDD7 for a similar miniature flat axehead that is dated from 2200-2000 BC.\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axehead on page 502, plate 69, no.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, which is associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.\n\nCowie &amp;amp; O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin &amp;amp; Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axehead with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.\n\nSchmidt &amp;amp; Burgess (1981) illustrate similar unclassified miniature flat axeheads with worn blades in pl.22, nos.266 &amp;amp; 283.\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

AGE</td><td>Solid gold armring with punched decoration. The armring is circular in section and curves in an oval shape, with overlapping terminals. Shallow punched dots cover the outer three quarters of the object. These measure approximately 1.44mm in diameter and are tightly clustered, with some overlap. There is noticeable wear to the outer edge of the object as the surface is smoother and the punched dots are much shallower.\n\nLength: 82.09mm\n\nWidth: 68.57mm\n\nDiameter: 11.55mm\n\nWeight: 311g\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe armring is similar in form to those of the Tullydonnell hoard from County Donegal, which were dated to c. 1200 - 800 BC. A direct parallel with punched decoration is known from Trimblestown Castle, County Meath, which is now in the collections of the National Museum of Ireland (Armstrong, E. C. R. (1920) Guide to the Collection of Irish Antiquities, p. 94, no. 412, pl. XVIII, no. 392). This was dated to c. 800 - 700 BC. The object is also paralleled by a larger example from The Lee, Buckinghamshire, recorded as a bracelet (Treasure Trove case no. 315 from 199/4, now in Buckinghamshire County Museum, Wendover). A small scale excavation at the findspot of the bracelet recovered no evidence of a feature or container but it was noted that the object came from the ploughsoil and may have been disturbed (Treasure Trove file, British Museum archive). Unlike the object under discussion, the punched dotted decoration on The Leeexample extended across the terminals. Similar punched decoration also appears on gold plated base metal late Bronze Age penannular rings (sometimes called bullae) of Lough Gara type (Ibid., p. 93, nos 404 - 406). Given the paucity of examples known, it is unclear whether this armring is an Irish or British type.\n\n\n\nAuthors:

Gold penannular bar bracelet fragment - Type 4B \n\nDimensions: surviving length 25.7mm; bar width 5.7mm; bar thickness 4mm; head width 9.8mm; head thickness 8.3mm; weight 7.36g.\n\nThis is a terminal fragment of a gold bar bracelet with a D-shape section. The bar expands abruptly to a solid, outwardly expanding flat terminal, also with a D-section. On the flat terminal face there is a slight penannular shaped hollow 0.5-1.0mm wide running around the sides and outer margins of the terminal. This is inset parallel with and approximately 0.5mm from the outer edge of the terminal face. The bar has been deliberately broken pre-deposition with a 'pinched' break, suggesting it was chiselled or cut, rather than bent and snapped. There is also one chisel mark on the flat face of the bar, which is close to the break and likely represents a failed impact mark. There are numerous and pronounced dents and impressed tool marks on the surface of the bracelet, which appear to be ancient, linked either with the forming of the bracelet or representing deliberate damage to the bracelet immediately prior to burial of the hoard.\n\n2. Copper alloy pin head or bracelet terminal fragment\n\nDimensions: surviving length 20.2mm; shaft diameter (below head) 4.8 x 5.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.6 x 3.2mm; surviving head depth 11.5mm; surviving head width 10.2mm; weight 2.33g.\n\nThis is a fragment of a circular-section bar of bronze that expands at one end to an incomplete terminal or head. The head/terminal is concave with a convex underside and was probably originally circular. Below the head/terminal the shaft is appears to have been decorated with at least three horizontal ribs, which are now very worn and shallow, and separated by at least two shallow grooves. The shaft appears to taper slightly, but degradation to the surface makes this difficult to discern.\n\nFragmentation has occurred around the circumference of the head/terminal so no original edge survives, and the object has broken across the bar/shaft in prehistory. This breakage is coupled with damage to the surface of the bronze, which is consistently patinated. The object is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges.\n\n3. Copper alloy penannular bracelet terminal fragment (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 4)\n\nDimensions: surviving curved length 35.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.4 x 2.7mm; surviving head diameter 9.3x8.1mm; weight 3.23g.\n\nThis is a fragment of a bracelet with a circular-section bar, gently expanding to a roughly oval terminal. The terminal is incomplete, and there is a prominent lateral ridge down the otherwise flat terminal. This ridge may be casting flash. The overall piece is curved, indicating it once formed part of a bracelet. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 4, below, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established, as the break points on both fragments are worn and eroded.\n\nThere are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, particularly around the terminal, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.\n\n4. Copper alloy incomplete possible bracelet (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 3)\n\nDimensions: bent length 45mm; maximum bar diameter 4.3x5mm; min. bar diameter 3.6x1.8mm; weight 7.6g.\n\nThis is a bronze bar, bent into a rough U-shape, with a rounded section, now heavily eroded so as to be inconsistent in diameter and section shape along the length. Where original surfaces survive, there is an angular, slightly projecting casting flash evident on both interior and exterior sides of the hoop. Both ends are broken, though one expands slightly, which might indicate this was approaching a terminal end. At one point, the bar has been deliberately and differentially bent out of shape, compressing the surviving ends out of shape and towards each other. At the point of bending, the bar is thin and compressed. The breakages at each end are worn and abraded. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 3, above, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established.\n\nThere are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.\n\n5. Copper alloy socketed axe - Slender faceted axe of Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham / Class D \n\nDimensions: maximum surviving length 91.2mm; maximum width cutting edge 51.1mm; external socket diameter (width x depth) 31.5 x 28.2mm; internal socket diameter (width x depth) 22.8 x 20.6mm; depth of collar 16.2mm; width of body below loop 27.2mm; depth of socket 62.6mm; weight 110.8g.\n\nThis is a near complete copper alloy socketed axe with an oval shaped socket mouth and a slender upper body that flares to a broad cutting edge. The body is roughly hexagonal in section, with two narrow and not particularly defined facets down each face margin. The socket mouth is flat and the collar is plain and flared. The base of the collar is defined by a prominent raised horizontal rib moulding, flanked by a shallow, poorly formed groove above and below. On the lower side, there is a second and poorly defined rib moulding, showing as a parallel raised ridge, beneath which the narrow facets originate. The rib moulding is straight on one face, but curved and irregular on the opposite face. The loop emerges below the collar and is of modest width. The faces of the axe are undecorated, with the exception of the facets, defined by grooves on each side of each face, starting from below the collar and following the shape of the axe. These grooves are shallow and poorly formed, stopping as the blade is expanding; the longest extends for 42.6mm.\n\nThe sides of the axe diverge greatly towards the cutting edge, creating a broad edge. The original cutting edge no longer survives and has fragmented unevenly, but was probably originally straight. One face of the axe has been worked to approximately 4.5mm above the surviving edge, though the opposite face shows limited signs of preparation. The blade appears to have been hammered out on the worked face, so the shape of the lower blade is asymmetrical; one half is almost crinoline in form, while the other simply flares out. This could be the result of hammering or a fault in the mould. There are numerous short horizontal striation marks across the worked face of the lower blade, which likely relate to sharpening or working activities, and in sections there are also vertical striations. The opposite face has a few macroscopic horizontal striations.\n\nThe molten bronze appears to have been cast in around the interior of the socket mouth, with two slightly raised lumps on the mouth identifiable as possible runner stumps. The casting seams down either side of the axe survive as raised, blunt ridges, but seem to have been hammered down. The slightly off-centre line of these seams indicates the axe was cast in slightly mismatched mould halves. On the no-loop side, there is a linear groove running beside the casting seam, suggesting an imperfection in the shaping of the mould. There are also three holes in the upper body and collar of the axe, which are casting defects where the metal has not filled the mould completely. An oval hole (7.7 x 5.4mm) is present in the flared section of the collar on the opposite side of the axe to the side loop. On the opposite face of the axe are two linearly aligned oval holes, one in the gap by the loop (c.4.5 x 7.7mm), and one about 5mm above it (4.1 x 6mm).\n\nThe axe is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, mottled with tan and orange patches. The socket mouth has suffered some minor material loss, which shows a small patch of green corrosion product forming, as does the fragmentary cutting edge.\n\n6. 7. and 8. Copper alloy socketed axe fragments - Type Croxton (conjoining fragments)\n\nDimensions: surviving length of No.6 54.9mm; surviving length of No.7 42.3mm; surviving length of No.8 24.8mm; external socket width 48.5mm; internal socket width 38.5mm; maximum collar depth 12.7mm; width of body below loop 38.2mm; width of No.7 18.8mm; width of No.8 24.4mm; weight No.6 76.7g; weight No.7 11.3g; weight No.8 9.2g; combined weight 97.1g.\n\nThese are three refitting fragments of an incomplete upper body of a ribbed socketed axe. The larger fragment (No.6) consists of one face of the upper body of a socketed axe, including the socket and collar, side loop, and upper part of the body bearing three vertical ribs. The second fragment (No.7) is much smaller and refits on the non-loop side, bearing part of the opposite face with two of the three ribs. The third fragment (No.8) is a small part of the socket mouth and moulding on the loop side, that forms an imperfect but probable refit with No. 6 and with very closely similar characteristics (e.g. the form and width of the collar, the same patina and unworn break edges), so that it can be concluded it was once part of the same axe. The area of refit between Nos. 6 and 8 indicates that there was some material loss during the breakage (e.g. a small section of metal) which would explain why these two fragments do not refit perfectly. The axe has split vertically down the socket, as well as across the body about 16.4mm below the side loop. \n\nThe socket end (visible on fragments 6 &amp;amp; 8) is defined by a flat-topped mouth, with a wide and plain onset collar with straight and slightly everted sides. Three parallel lateral raised ribs extend from the base of the collar (fragment 6) and terminate below the point of breakage, though do not converge. Two of these have worn down or damaged. The surviving socket indicates it was originally sub-rectangular with rounded corners and the body was broadly hexagonal, with angular face edges. A narrow loop descends from the base of the collar, with the external casting seam on the loop placed off centre. Prominent raised casting seams are present on both sides of the axe fragment, though are blunt, suggesting they have been hammered down.\n\nFragment No.7 represents the corner of the upper body of the axe and part of the face with two lateral raised ribs. Fragment No.8 represents the corner of a flat-topped socket mouth,\n\nwith a deep onset collar moulding of identical proportions to No.6. The possible remains of a worn runner stump are visible on the mouth of fragment No. 8. This fragment has broken unevenly along three sides.\n\nAll fragments are largely covered in a dark brown patina, but this has delaminated in patches around the socket collar and along the ribs, leaving tan and pale green corrosion. All of the breakages along the sides, socket and body are soil covered, but not significantly eroded and retaining localised angularities along the breaks, suggesting that the breaks occurred while buried, rather than during retrieval.\n\n9. Probable small face wall fragment of a ribbed socketed axe (probably part of Croxton Type socketed axe No. 6-8)\n\nDimensions: length 16.1mm; width 9.0mm; thickness 2.1mm; weight 1.27g.\n\nThis is a small, thin fragment of bronze, broken along all edges in antiquity. On one face, adjacent to a break line, there is a straight linear ridge, consistent with a decorative rib from the face of a ribbed socketed axe. The wall thickness of 2.1mm evident on this fragment is also consistent with the range of wall thicknesses seen on bronze socketed axes. One corner of this bronze fragment has been distorted, suggesting impact damage at some point, either in antiquity or more recent times.\n\nThere is a small patch of dark brown patina surviving on both faces at one end, though the original surface has delaminated from the rest of the object revealing pale green corrosion.\n\n10. Copper alloy spearhead fragment - probably Group 11\n\nDimensions: surviving length 47.7mm; width at breakage 22.3mm; depth at breakage (across midrib) 7mm; thickness at tip 6.2mm; weight 14.5g.\n\nThis is a tip fragment of a socketed spearhead, broken unevenly in antiquity. It has a low, rounded midrib, and thick narrow blade wings, creating a pointed ovate section. The edge is abraded, making it difficult to determine the original form of the blade, but the slender nature of the tip indicates it may have been flame-shaped. The surviving tip is thick and blunt.\n\nThe spearhead seems to have broken pre-deposition across the upper blade, below the internal socket aperture. There is still material embedded in the socket, making it unclear how much further the socket extends. The break is uneven as one blade wing survives more than the other.\n\nThe fragment is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, particularly on the midrib, revealing green corrosion.\n\n11. Copper alloy blade fragment - probable sword\n\nDimensions: surviving length 76.7mm; width at breaks 19.6 and 28.7mm; thickness at breaks 5.6 and 7.5mm; weight 66.3g.\n\nThis is a narrow fragment of a blade, broken at both ends. The blade tapers to one end, suggesting it is from the lower blade, towards the tip. It has a curved midrib, creating a biconvex section. The blade edges are abraded and there are no signs of bevels.\n\nThe breaks are consistently patinated and rough, suggesting the breakages occurred shortly before deposition. The breaks have occurred largely straight across the blade and show no signs of casting flaws, inclusions or porosity. The narrower end has a very slight transverse bend (c.3/4 degrees) associated with the break, though there are no other associated marks.\n\nThe fragment is largely covered in an uneven dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, revealing pale brown degradation.\n\n12. Copper alloy casting jet - four runner form\n\nDimensions: top surface length 43.8mm; top surface width 21.4mm; maximum height 32.8mm; depth of pouring reservoir 17.5mm; weight 74.7g.\n\nThis is an oval-shaped jet with four runners, offset from the centre of the pouring reservoir. The reservoir is quite deep and has a rough, uneven upper surface. The underside of one end tapers in with straight sides towards the runners, while the other has more upright and straight sides leading down, shaped by the top of the mould. There is also a small bronze protrusion at the tapering end of the reservoir, while four runners extend from the base. These runners occur as two sets of two. Two are short (c.11mm) and rounded, with a slight split between them. The second pair are longer (17.7mm) and flatter, diverging more greatly, tapering from thick, broad protrusions to narrow stumps.\n\nThe jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.\n\n13. Copper alloy casting jet - two runner form\n\nDimensions: top surface length 27.7mm; top surface width 21mm; maximum height 32.9mm; depth of pouring reservoir 14.1mm; weight 53.5g. \n\nThis a semi-rectangular shaped jet in plan with two runners. The upper surface, of rectangular shape, is straight at the short ends, but tapers slightly in along the longer sides, shaped by the top of the mould. One runner is shorter (7.8mm) with an oval-section. The other runner is broad (17.3mm) and long (19mm) with a D-shaped section.\n\nThe jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.\n\n14. Copper alloy annular ring\n\nDimensions: external diameter 30 x 29.1mm; internal diameter 22 x 22.4mm; bar diameter 3.8 - 4.0mm; weight 4.8g.\n\nThis is a complete circular, annular bronze ring with a circular section.\n\nThe ring is largely covered in a dark brown patina, but the surface has delaminated in patches revealing pale green corrosion.\n\n15. Copper alloy complex circular object - possible vehicle wheel axle fitting or turning cap\n\nDimensions: diameter 52.3mm; height 30mm; height of cylinder c.21mm; internal diameter 25mm; thickness (of base) 9mm; weight 123.7g.\n\nThis is a cast, circular and hollow cylindrical object with a thick outer face and a circular perforation through the centre, with an inset projecting cylinder on the inner face. The margins of the disc, around both external diameter and internal perforation are bevelled, to give a presentable finish. The outer face is thick, heavy and wide, while the walls of the narrower internal cylinder are thinner. Part of the cylinder has broken away on one side. The cylinder tapers in at the centre of the body, before expanding again to a biconical moulding. There is a cast oval perforation through the narrow cylinder wall, while there is an aligning and corresponding curved groove across the underside of the outer disc. This appears to have once held a pin in place, to attach the casting to a larger composite object. The underside surface of the outer disc has diagonally aligned and parallel file or tool marks adjacent to the outer margins, while towards the interior the surface is covered with concentric linear striations, hinting at modern machine finishing.\n\nThe object is covered in a dark green patina.\n\nThis object was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as superficially reminiscent of known chariot or cart fittings of Late Bronze Age and Iron Age date. \n\n16. Copper alloy casting waste - possibly slag\n\nDimensions: length 34.2mm; width 29.0mm; maximum thickness 17.0mm; min thickness 3.0mm; weight 15.4g.\n\nThis is a small, rough piece of casting waste, probably slag, with an uneven surface, caused by the cooling of the metal. The piece is irregularly-shaped and thicker at one end than the other.\n\nThis piece is covered in green corrosion.\n\nThis slag fragment was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as consistent in general characteristics with bronze slag and casting waste associated elsewhere with Late Bronze Age hoards. </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                          </span></td><td>13</td><td>13</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>   NA</span></td><td>⋯</td><td> 1</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Brecknock Museum             </span></td><td>23</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Gold        </span></td><td>10892</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA           </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  NA</span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>  NA</span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>NA                                                                            </span></td></tr>\n\t<tr><th scope=row>8</th><td>finds-961742</td><td>961742</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>WMID-349A3E  </span></td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>FLAT AXEHEAD   </span></td><td>BRONZE AGE</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).\n\nThe flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 17.1 mm (thickness: 2.0 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are gently curved. The axe is thickest at the mid point (8.6 mm), with no traces of a proto stop ridge present. Potential decoration is present on one side as four circular depressions around the mid point. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 34.3 mm (2.6 mm thick). The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. \n\nIt measures 80.7 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 34.3 mm, width at the butt is 17.1 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 8.6 mm. It weighs 77.7 grams.\n\nThe axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\nReference:\n\nNeedham, S.

AGE</td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Description: &amp;nbsp;A fragment of gold flange-twisted torc dating to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1300-1100&amp;nbsp;BC). The fragment is a small section of the four-flanged twisted bar that is cruciform or &amp;#39;+&amp;#39; shaped in cross-section. It is broken at both ends.\n\n\n\nMeasurements: The fragment measures 19.2mm in length, a maximum of 8.9mm wide, 8.2mm thick and weighs 3.31 grams.\n\n\n\nConclusion:&amp;nbsp; Made of gold and of Bronze Age date, the fragment is evidently of a precious metal and over 300 years old, and therefore constitutes treasure under the Treasure Act (1996).

The ribbon is sub-rectangular in plan and made from a sheet of gold. One side of the ribbon is decorated with eight regular, longitudinal, incised grooves. The other side of the ribbon is plain with some light scratches. The ribbon is folded almost half-way down to face the reverse side and folds again at the terminal which has rough damaged edges. The damage is not new. The other end has a neat, flat-ended terminal with sharp 90 degree corners. There is a circular perforation at this end of the ribbon on the fourth and fifth ridge which is slightly off-centre. The diameter of the perforation is 1.1mm. There is an indentation on one edge of the ribbon by the terminal. On the decorated side of the ribbon, the perforation is surrounded by a lip and on the back of the ribbon it is surrounded by a shallow recess indicating that the perforation was punched through from the reverse side. The opposing end of the ribbon is also square-shaped but the edge has been bent over back to rest toward the perforated side of the ribbon. It is a little rough around the edges. There are also some longitudinal scratches and scuff marks on this plain side of the ribbon.\n\nDimensions:\n\nLength: 17.8mm\n\nWidth: 6.6mm\n\nThickness: 3.93\n\nWeight: 1.3g.\n\nDiscussion: \n\nA similar grooved, pierced gold ribbon is recorded under Treasure number 2012 T577 (ESS-C13B97), and other similar types of ribbons include: 2013 T326 (WILT-26F931), 2007 T692 (WAW-C0C0B3), 2014 T63 (BERK-387817), and 2013 T154 (PAS-067AC5).\n\nThe incised linear decoration of the strip can be paralleled on a number of gold strips and 'ribbons' of known and very probable Bronze Age date, particularly the find from Sherborne St John, Hampshire (2013 T154), which also had a single perforation to one and was decorated on only one side. The dimensions and weights of the bands are also comparable. The Tendering strip also bears comparison with gold strips from The Hamel, Oxfordshire (Case 1981; Palmer 1981); Corringham, Lincolnshire (2011 T459); Sproxton, North Yorkshire (2010 T664); Flixton, North Yorkshire (2003 T40a&amp;amp;b); and Ansley, Warwickshire (2007 T672). The find from The Hamel, Oxfordshire, came from the same layer as typologically late Beaker pottery dating to the Early Bronze Age (cf. Needham 2005).\n\nConclusion: Due to the precious metal content of this object being over 10% gold, and it being over 300 years old, this object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.

unfolded Copper Age basket ornament dated to 2500-2200BC. This item, possibly hair ornaments or ear rings, has been cut from thin gold sheet and would normally have been wrapped into a cylindrical 'basket' shape. This example has been flattened out and shows the full extent of the oval plate which is 38mm long and 16mm wide with semi-circular ends and long straight sides. The interior of the plate is decorated with two concentric lines that run around the outside, inside of this are four zones of about five to six vertical lines running perpendicular to the long edges. This plate is heavily damaged with extensive creasing at either end, plus an off centre crease that runs the length of the plate. Protruding for the centre of one of the long edges is a long and thin (21mm long, 2.5mm wide) tang that would have ultimately been wrapped around the rolled cylindrical plate. As with the plate the tang is heavily creased.\n\nAn almost exact parallel was found in South Oxfordshire 2012 T774 BERK-0D1A05, but also see BERK-F548E6, SUSS-096CEB, LON-FF7E65 and BH-956274\n\nThis class of object belongs to the earliest phases of metallurgy in Britain. These are usually associated with burials and a very rare, dating to the earliest phase of the Bronze Age, c. 2400-2200 BC. Such objects are variously referred to as 'basket ornaments' or 'basket earrings', or 'hair rings'. They are in any case personal ornaments, and have been found in pairs in graves dating to the early Beaker period. Whether worn on hair, ears or items of costume, they were rolled into a basket shape in use.\n\nIn shape and decoration this example falls into Needham's Atlantic Group B (ii) (Needham 2011). Closely similar ornaments were found in Beaker burials at Chilbolton, Hants and Radley 4a, Oxfordshire (Kinnes 1994).

flange- or bar-twisted gold torc bent almost in half on itself longitudinally, with breaks at either end. The torc has a cruciform (x-shaped) cross-section with four flanges, although they twist in such a way as to give a circular cross-section around the flanges. The breaks are quite sharp, suggesting they could be quite recent. The bend is not quite at the centre of the object.\nThe ends, both slightly squashed, measure 8.2x6.2mm and 8.4x7.3mm. At these breaks the flanges are c.0.6-0.8mm thick, with a thickened rim (slightly flattened to the outside surface) 0.9-1.0mm thick. At the deepest, the depth between the flanges is c.2.5mm deep. The width/ diameter of the object is relatively parallel and c.9mm.\nThe fragment measures 41.6mm in bent length (unbent it would be c.75mm), 26.8mm in max width and 8.9mm in max.thickness. It weighs 18.24g.

incomplete, probably dating to c. 1300-1150 BC. The object consists of two concavo-convex bands of gold sheet which appear to have been soldered together and curved around to form a loop, the latter left open.\n\nDimensions: diameter 13.9mm; width 7.9mm; thickness 2.3mm; weight 3.26g.\n\nDiscussion: Comparison to other artefacts of the same type would suggest that the present artefact formed the outer cover for a base metal or organic core, along with an inner gold sheet, cf. YORYM-06C5C1, BERK-E2ED60, NMS-ACBFA4 on the PAS database.  \n\nThe penannular ring appears to consist of over 10% precious metal and to be over 300 years old at the time of finding and as such qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.\n\nWil Partridge\nFinds Liaison Officer for Wiltshire\nMarch 2019

It is made from a single length of 2.7mm diameter, copper alloy wire, one end of which is a tightly wound to form a six turn spiral. From this the wire is bent back on itself to form a hook-like catch plate. The wire is twisted back and forth to form five, figure of 8 loops on the end of which is an integral pin. The wire is cracked at this point. The brooch is in excellent condition with a mid-brown patination which contains some grains of sand. Length 99.3mm, Width 41.7mm, Height 26.2mm, Mass 30.31g.\n\nThis brooch is of Central European type and can be closely paralleled by two examples found in a hoard of gold jewellery on the bank of the Danube between Duna-Földvár and Paks in Hungary. This was dated to the 11th to 9th century BC (Hugh Tait, 7000 years of Jewellery, The British Museum, 2006, 51, plate 108). A further parallel is provided by an example in Merseyside Museums which is provenance as 'Northern Hungary' (Susan Nicholson, Catalogue of the Prehistoric Metalwork in the Merseyside County Museums, Merseyside County Council, Liverpool,, 1980, 70, No. 141.\n\nWhile it is not impossible for this object to have found its way to England in antiquity its condition, and the fact that it was a surface find, suggest that it may be a recent import, perhaps coming from a European collection during the Second World War and, its significance unrecognised, subsequently lost.

Cast pentagonal-section strip, broken at one end and flattened to spatulate form at the other. The section is angular, with two low and probably worn facets on what is taken to have been the display or outer face, producing a gently keeled appearance. This is carried along the object to the spatulate end, which may therefore be regarded as a deliberately fashioned terminal to a penannular and probably symmetrical form, with its equivalent now lost. The object is now curved with two sharper and one more gentle bends, with two cracks near the latter. The finder kindly notes that the curved parts near the flat terminal and towards the other end of the object both fit snugly against the wrist if the keeled face is set outwards, though of course the object may as easily be worn around the neck. The finder also notes the object has been tested - presumably non-destructively - and its material confirmed as 'pure gold'. Extensive search around the find spot has yet to reveal the missing fragment. Suggested date: Late Bronze Age, 1000-800 BC\n\nGiven its age and material the object is to be subjected to the Treasure process, Ref. 2019 T188. Its association with other Bronze Age finds reported from the vicinity also commends it as a 'find of note'.\n\nLength: 127mm, Width: 18.4mm, Thickness: 3.4mm, Weight: 48.58gms

    </td><td>BRONZE AGE</td><td>Copper alloy spear head. Cast pegged and socketed spearhead, retaining the end of a wooden shaft within, which is now pale brown in colour and fibrous in its appearance. The spearhead takes the form of a regular cone with opposed flanges forming blades which extend from the pointed tip for 71mm, or to 21mm above the mouth of the socket. Opposed drilled holes are set 9.4mm, or half way between socket and flanges, and are aligned with them. One of these holes is of 4mm diameter; the other retains the burred head of a rivet of diameter 4.4mm. Three finely incised circumferential lines immediately below them may have served to set out the holes. Above them, a zig-zag pattern of elongated dots - or perhaps dashes given the form - produces a series of six triangles between the rivet holes and a seventh carried over the occupied hole, with each triangle of height 4mm. A further two circumferential lines of dots are carried around the socket mouth below the triplicated continuous lines.\n\nThe outer cutting edges of the blades are lightly abraded, showing a green tint against an overall brown patina, and along with limited abrasions on one side of the object these are the only indications of deterioration or damage. As with other objects of the period hereabouts, the spearhead appears to have been deposited in working order. The practice of ritual 'killing' of an object does not seem to figure here.\n\nThe triplicate decoration combined with zig-zag motifs recurs in WAW-C65A09, a spearhead recently reported from Warwickshire. That example is held to be of later Bronze Age date, 1150-600 BC. In this case, the relative proportions of blade and socket are different, with more blade and less socket. A stubby peg-hole spearhead from Burton on Stather, North Lincolnshire, displayed in the North Lincolnshire Museum, more closely resembles this example, and is ascribed to the Early Bronze Age, probably c.1600BC or thereafter.\n\nSuggested date: Middle to Late Bronze age, 1600-800 BC\n\nLength: 94mm, Width (at blade): 24.5mm, Diameter (socket): 22.6mm, Thickness (wall, at mouth of socket):

gold sheet around a copper alloy core. The ring is oval in plan with a triangular cross-sectional profile. The face has a pronounced midrib and eight smaller concentric ribs running around either side of the face (17 ribs in total) suggesting construction from gold wire, in contrast to the gold sheeting of the inner surface and terminals which is flat and undecorated. The opening in the ring has been damaged, with the gold plate broken to reveal the corroded copper alloy core.

The ring is in the shape of an oval-sectioned loop. Many of these penannular rings have a copper alloy core wrapped in gold sheet; however, it is not entirely clear if this is the case for this example, as there are to chips or brakes showing the core.\n\nThere are many examples of these objects recorded in the PAS database. Some of these include: BH-719492 (2018 T761), PAS-011055 (2016 T920), KENT-FF00A6 (2018 T376) and HAMP-425F0D (2018 T89).\n\nThese penannular rings are sometimes known as 'ring-money' or 'hair rings' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008) [References from NMGW-04216C]. The function of these objects remain relatively unknown, having been possibly identified as currency for exchange, or ornaments worn by people to display wealth and power.

&amp;lsquo;chisel-cut&amp;rsquo; way) on either end. The object has a sub-hexagonal cross-section. \n\nDimensions: Length: 18mm; Width: 6mm; Thickness: 4.5mm; Weight: 4.32g \n\nMetal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of a gold bar fragment by the British Museum, indicated a surface composition of approximately 81-83% gold, 14-16% silver, the rest being largely copper. See appended report. \n\nDiscussion: This fragment is similar in appearance &amp;ndash; and, perhaps most notably, style of pincer-like cut &amp;ndash; to the fragments from the Middle Bronze Age hoard from Fittleworth hoard (of 42 objects), also found in West Sussex (see Treasure Trove Reviewing Committee Annual Report 1996-1997 p.7-8, no.1, now in the British museum registration BEP 1996, 0902.1ff). In particular, comparison can be made with fragments BEP 1996, 0902.1-3. \n\nNon-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis&amp;nbsp;indicated a surface composition of approximately 81-83% gold, 14-16% silver, the rest being largely copper.&amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;composition is consistent with a Bronze Age date. \n\nConclusion: On the balance of probabilities, this object qualifies as Treasure under the Treasure Act (1996), by virtue of being of prehistoric date and comprising of more than 10% precious metal.

  | FLAT AXEHEAD    | BRONZE AGE | A complete copper alloy flat axehead, probably dating from the Early Bronze Age period (c. BC 2350 - c. BC 2050).&amp;nbsp;\nThe axe is broadly rectangular in plan with a slightly splayed crescentric blade. In profile and in section the object is broadly lentoid.\nThe sides of the axe gently taper outwards with a shallow curve, from the rounded butt to the blade. The curve is less shallow towards the blade. The axehead has suffered significant loss from corrosion on all surfaces, particularly at the blade and the butt.\nThe axehead measures 67.4 mm in length, the butt is 18.1 mm wide and the blade measures 27.3 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 3.8 mm, the ridge measures 10.9 mm thick and the blade is 2.1 mm thick. The axehead weighs 59 g.\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham&amp;#39;s (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL.&amp;nbsp;BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\nReference:\n\nNeedham, S.

PAS-35C8A8    | RIBBON          | BRONZE AGE | Folded gold strip or diadem. Soil remains wedged between layers. The object has been folded up and consists of 5-6 layers. The tapering tip of one end of the strip is visible on the outside of the folded bundle. Lines of pointillé decoration run along both edges of the strip and meet at the terminal. There are three perforations visible on a terminal of the band that tapers inwards forming a triangle with the single perforation at the tip of the taper en\n\nDimensions (in folded condition):\n\nLength: 28.23mm\nWidth: 19.93mm\nThickness (with soil): 5.33mm\n\nThickness (sheet): 0.18mm\nWeight (with soil): 8.55g\n\nMetal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the strip (undertaken at the British Museum) indicated a surface composition of approximately 92-94% gold and 6-8% silver, the rest (less than 1%) being copper. (See appended report).\n\nCurators note: this is a very similar composition to the very similar band from Berinsfield, South Oxfordshire (Treasure case 2016 T521).\n\nDiscussion: Of Early Bronze Age date (c.2500 - 1500 BC), and now in two pieces, this is only the fifth or sixth example of this type of object from Britain. These objects are rare and are not yet fully understood; it is likely to date from the earliest Bronze Age / Chacolithic period, c. 2500-2200 BC and as such is part of a select group of objects that represent the earliest gold objects in Britain.\n\nThe function or what object this mount decorated is not certain; suggestions include scabbard fittings, diadem or neck choker/band, or perhaps a decorative strip attached to leather. A similar object was reported as Treasure in 2005, case number 2005T21 (from 'near Winchester' - the provenance is vague - acquired by the British Museum: 2008, 8019.1) (Needham &amp;amp; Sheridan 2014, 908-9). The 'near Winchester' find also has three perforations set within the terminals in a similar fashion to a recently reported item from Stratford-Upon-Avon (Treasure case 2016 T209), and Berinsfield, South Oxfordshire (Treasure case 2016 T521).

FLAT AXEHEAD    | BRONZE AGE | Incomplete cast copper alloy miniature flat axehead, sub-triangular in plan, and slightly lozenge-shaped in profile, with an undeveloped, straight-sided blade that has worn to a curve on one side. From the blade the axe tapers to a narrow rounded butt end, that is 14 mm wide. The sides of the blade expand slightly and meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 27 mm. The curve of the blade suggests that it was not probably used as an axehead but instead perhaps buried as a representation of a larger functional axehead at a time when bronze was too valuable to bury. The length of the flat axe is only 76 mm so it less than half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.\n\nSee CORN-7ACDD7 for a similar miniature flat axehead that is dated from 2200-2000 BC.\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axehead on page 502, plate 69, no.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, which is associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.\n\nCowie &amp;amp; O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin &amp;amp; Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axehead with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.\n\nSchmidt &amp;amp; Burgess (1981) illustrate similar unclassified miniature flat axeheads with worn blades in pl.22, nos.266 &amp;amp; 283.\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\nNeedham, S.

  | BRONZE AGE | An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).\n\nThe flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with an incomplete rounded shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 12.0 mm (thickness: 2.4 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. The axe is thickest at the mid point (6.0 mm), with no sign of a proto stop ridge. The sides of the blade expand to produce a rounded blade edge with an abraded width of 34.4 mm (thickness 3.6 mm). \n\nThe axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\nIt measures 72.5 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 34.4 mm, width at the butt is 12.0 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 6.0 mm. It weighs 48.6 grams.\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\nReference:\n\nNeedham, S.

From the blade the axe tapers to a narrow rounded butt end, that is 14 mm wide. The sides of the blade do not expand but meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 29 mm. The curve of the blade suggests that it was not probably used as an axehead but instead perhaps buried as a representation of a larger functional axehead at a time when bronze was too valuable to bury. The length of the flat axe is only 83 mm so it less than half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.\n\nSee CORN-7ACDD7 for a similar miniature flat axehead that is dated from 2200-2000 BC.\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axehead on page 502, plate 69, no.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, which is associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.\n\nCowie &amp;amp; O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin &amp;amp; Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axehead with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.\n\nSchmidt &amp;amp; Burgess (1981) illustrate similar unclassified miniature flat axeheads with worn blades in pl.22, nos.266 &amp;amp; 283.\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

| TORC            | BRONZE AGE | Solid gold armring with punched decoration. The armring is circular in section and curves in an oval shape, with overlapping terminals. Shallow punched dots cover the outer three quarters of the object. These measure approximately 1.44mm in diameter and are tightly clustered, with some overlap. There is noticeable wear to the outer edge of the object as the surface is smoother and the punched dots are much shallower.\n\nLength: 82.09mm\n\nWidth: 68.57mm\n\nDiameter: 11.55mm\n\nWeight: 311g\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe armring is similar in form to those of the Tullydonnell hoard from County Donegal, which were dated to c. 1200 - 800 BC. A direct parallel with punched decoration is known from Trimblestown Castle, County Meath, which is now in the collections of the National Museum of Ireland (Armstrong, E. C. R. (1920) Guide to the Collection of Irish Antiquities, p. 94, no. 412, pl. XVIII, no. 392). This was dated to c. 800 - 700 BC. The object is also paralleled by a larger example from The Lee, Buckinghamshire, recorded as a bracelet (Treasure Trove case no. 315 from 199/4, now in Buckinghamshire County Museum, Wendover). A small scale excavation at the findspot of the bracelet recovered no evidence of a feature or container but it was noted that the object came from the ploughsoil and may have been disturbed (Treasure Trove file, British Museum archive). Unlike the object under discussion, the punched dotted decoration on The Leeexample extended across the terminals. Similar punched decoration also appears on gold plated base metal late Bronze Age penannular rings (sometimes called bullae) of Lough Gara type (Ibid., p. 93, nos 404 - 406). Given the paucity of examples known, it is unclear whether this armring is an Irish or British type.\n\n\n\nAuthors:

Gold penannular bar bracelet fragment - Type 4B \n\nDimensions: surviving length 25.7mm; bar width 5.7mm; bar thickness 4mm; head width 9.8mm; head thickness 8.3mm; weight 7.36g.\n\nThis is a terminal fragment of a gold bar bracelet with a D-shape section. The bar expands abruptly to a solid, outwardly expanding flat terminal, also with a D-section. On the flat terminal face there is a slight penannular shaped hollow 0.5-1.0mm wide running around the sides and outer margins of the terminal. This is inset parallel with and approximately 0.5mm from the outer edge of the terminal face. The bar has been deliberately broken pre-deposition with a 'pinched' break, suggesting it was chiselled or cut, rather than bent and snapped. There is also one chisel mark on the flat face of the bar, which is close to the break and likely represents a failed impact mark. There are numerous and pronounced dents and impressed tool marks on the surface of the bracelet, which appear to be ancient, linked either with the forming of the bracelet or representing deliberate damage to the bracelet immediately prior to burial of the hoard.\n\n2. Copper alloy pin head or bracelet terminal fragment\n\nDimensions: surviving length 20.2mm; shaft diameter (below head) 4.8 x 5.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.6 x 3.2mm; surviving head depth 11.5mm; surviving head width 10.2mm; weight 2.33g.\n\nThis is a fragment of a circular-section bar of bronze that expands at one end to an incomplete terminal or head. The head/terminal is concave with a convex underside and was probably originally circular. Below the head/terminal the shaft is appears to have been decorated with at least three horizontal ribs, which are now very worn and shallow, and separated by at least two shallow grooves. The shaft appears to taper slightly, but degradation to the surface makes this difficult to discern.\n\nFragmentation has occurred around the circumference of the head/terminal so no original edge survives, and the object has broken across the bar/shaft in prehistory. This breakage is coupled with damage to the surface of the bronze, which is consistently patinated. The object is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges.\n\n3. Copper alloy penannular bracelet terminal fragment (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 4)\n\nDimensions: surviving curved length 35.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.4 x 2.7mm; surviving head diameter 9.3x8.1mm; weight 3.23g.\n\nThis is a fragment of a bracelet with a circular-section bar, gently expanding to a roughly oval terminal. The terminal is incomplete, and there is a prominent lateral ridge down the otherwise flat terminal. This ridge may be casting flash. The overall piece is curved, indicating it once formed part of a bracelet. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 4, below, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established, as the break points on both fragments are worn and eroded.\n\nThere are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, particularly around the terminal, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.\n\n4. Copper alloy incomplete possible bracelet (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 3)\n\nDimensions: bent length 45mm; maximum bar diameter 4.3x5mm; min. bar diameter 3.6x1.8mm; weight 7.6g.\n\nThis is a bronze bar, bent into a rough U-shape, with a rounded section, now heavily eroded so as to be inconsistent in diameter and section shape along the length. Where original surfaces survive, there is an angular, slightly projecting casting flash evident on both interior and exterior sides of the hoop. Both ends are broken, though one expands slightly, which might indicate this was approaching a terminal end. At one point, the bar has been deliberately and differentially bent out of shape, compressing the surviving ends out of shape and towards each other. At the point of bending, the bar is thin and compressed. The breakages at each end are worn and abraded. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 3, above, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established.\n\nThere are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.\n\n5. Copper alloy socketed axe - Slender faceted axe of Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham / Class D \n\nDimensions: maximum surviving length 91.2mm; maximum width cutting edge 51.1mm; external socket diameter (width x depth) 31.5 x 28.2mm; internal socket diameter (width x depth) 22.8 x 20.6mm; depth of collar 16.2mm; width of body below loop 27.2mm; depth of socket 62.6mm; weight 110.8g.\n\nThis is a near complete copper alloy socketed axe with an oval shaped socket mouth and a slender upper body that flares to a broad cutting edge. The body is roughly hexagonal in section, with two narrow and not particularly defined facets down each face margin. The socket mouth is flat and the collar is plain and flared. The base of the collar is defined by a prominent raised horizontal rib moulding, flanked by a shallow, poorly formed groove above and below. On the lower side, there is a second and poorly defined rib moulding, showing as a parallel raised ridge, beneath which the narrow facets originate. The rib moulding is straight on one face, but curved and irregular on the opposite face. The loop emerges below the collar and is of modest width. The faces of the axe are undecorated, with the exception of the facets, defined by grooves on each side of each face, starting from below the collar and following the shape of the axe. These grooves are shallow and poorly formed, stopping as the blade is expanding; the longest extends for 42.6mm.\n\nThe sides of the axe diverge greatly towards the cutting edge, creating a broad edge. The original cutting edge no longer survives and has fragmented unevenly, but was probably originally straight. One face of the axe has been worked to approximately 4.5mm above the surviving edge, though the opposite face shows limited signs of preparation. The blade appears to have been hammered out on the worked face, so the shape of the lower blade is asymmetrical; one half is almost crinoline in form, while the other simply flares out. This could be the result of hammering or a fault in the mould. There are numerous short horizontal striation marks across the worked face of the lower blade, which likely relate to sharpening or working activities, and in sections there are also vertical striations. The opposite face has a few macroscopic horizontal striations.\n\nThe molten bronze appears to have been cast in around the interior of the socket mouth, with two slightly raised lumps on the mouth identifiable as possible runner stumps. The casting seams down either side of the axe survive as raised, blunt ridges, but seem to have been hammered down. The slightly off-centre line of these seams indicates the axe was cast in slightly mismatched mould halves. On the no-loop side, there is a linear groove running beside the casting seam, suggesting an imperfection in the shaping of the mould. There are also three holes in the upper body and collar of the axe, which are casting defects where the metal has not filled the mould completely. An oval hole (7.7 x 5.4mm) is present in the flared section of the collar on the opposite side of the axe to the side loop. On the opposite face of the axe are two linearly aligned oval holes, one in the gap by the loop (c.4.5 x 7.7mm), and one about 5mm above it (4.1 x 6mm).\n\nThe axe is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, mottled with tan and orange patches. The socket mouth has suffered some minor material loss, which shows a small patch of green corrosion product forming, as does the fragmentary cutting edge.\n\n6. 7. and 8. Copper alloy socketed axe fragments - Type Croxton (conjoining fragments)\n\nDimensions: surviving length of No.6 54.9mm; surviving length of No.7 42.3mm; surviving length of No.8 24.8mm; external socket width 48.5mm; internal socket width 38.5mm; maximum collar depth 12.7mm; width of body below loop 38.2mm; width of No.7 18.8mm; width of No.8 24.4mm; weight No.6 76.7g; weight No.7 11.3g; weight No.8 9.2g; combined weight 97.1g.\n\nThese are three refitting fragments of an incomplete upper body of a ribbed socketed axe. The larger fragment (No.6) consists of one face of the upper body of a socketed axe, including the socket and collar, side loop, and upper part of the body bearing three vertical ribs. The second fragment (No.7) is much smaller and refits on the non-loop side, bearing part of the opposite face with two of the three ribs. The third fragment (No.8) is a small part of the socket mouth and moulding on the loop side, that forms an imperfect but probable refit with No. 6 and with very closely similar characteristics (e.g. the form and width of the collar, the same patina and unworn break edges), so that it can be concluded it was once part of the same axe. The area of refit between Nos. 6 and 8 indicates that there was some material loss during the breakage (e.g. a small section of metal) which would explain why these two fragments do not refit perfectly. The axe has split vertically down the socket, as well as across the body about 16.4mm below the side loop. \n\nThe socket end (visible on fragments 6 &amp;amp; 8) is defined by a flat-topped mouth, with a wide and plain onset collar with straight and slightly everted sides. Three parallel lateral raised ribs extend from the base of the collar (fragment 6) and terminate below the point of breakage, though do not converge. Two of these have worn down or damaged. The surviving socket indicates it was originally sub-rectangular with rounded corners and the body was broadly hexagonal, with angular face edges. A narrow loop descends from the base of the collar, with the external casting seam on the loop placed off centre. Prominent raised casting seams are present on both sides of the axe fragment, though are blunt, suggesting they have been hammered down.\n\nFragment No.7 represents the corner of the upper body of the axe and part of the face with two lateral raised ribs. Fragment No.8 represents the corner of a flat-topped socket mouth,\n\nwith a deep onset collar moulding of identical proportions to No.6. The possible remains of a worn runner stump are visible on the mouth of fragment No. 8. This fragment has broken unevenly along three sides.\n\nAll fragments are largely covered in a dark brown patina, but this has delaminated in patches around the socket collar and along the ribs, leaving tan and pale green corrosion. All of the breakages along the sides, socket and body are soil covered, but not significantly eroded and retaining localised angularities along the breaks, suggesting that the breaks occurred while buried, rather than during retrieval.\n\n9. Probable small face wall fragment of a ribbed socketed axe (probably part of Croxton Type socketed axe No. 6-8)\n\nDimensions: length 16.1mm; width 9.0mm; thickness 2.1mm; weight 1.27g.\n\nThis is a small, thin fragment of bronze, broken along all edges in antiquity. On one face, adjacent to a break line, there is a straight linear ridge, consistent with a decorative rib from the face of a ribbed socketed axe. The wall thickness of 2.1mm evident on this fragment is also consistent with the range of wall thicknesses seen on bronze socketed axes. One corner of this bronze fragment has been distorted, suggesting impact damage at some point, either in antiquity or more recent times.\n\nThere is a small patch of dark brown patina surviving on both faces at one end, though the original surface has delaminated from the rest of the object revealing pale green corrosion.\n\n10. Copper alloy spearhead fragment - probably Group 11\n\nDimensions: surviving length 47.7mm; width at breakage 22.3mm; depth at breakage (across midrib) 7mm; thickness at tip 6.2mm; weight 14.5g.\n\nThis is a tip fragment of a socketed spearhead, broken unevenly in antiquity. It has a low, rounded midrib, and thick narrow blade wings, creating a pointed ovate section. The edge is abraded, making it difficult to determine the original form of the blade, but the slender nature of the tip indicates it may have been flame-shaped. The surviving tip is thick and blunt.\n\nThe spearhead seems to have broken pre-deposition across the upper blade, below the internal socket aperture. There is still material embedded in the socket, making it unclear how much further the socket extends. The break is uneven as one blade wing survives more than the other.\n\nThe fragment is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, particularly on the midrib, revealing green corrosion.\n\n11. Copper alloy blade fragment - probable sword\n\nDimensions: surviving length 76.7mm; width at breaks 19.6 and 28.7mm; thickness at breaks 5.6 and 7.5mm; weight 66.3g.\n\nThis is a narrow fragment of a blade, broken at both ends. The blade tapers to one end, suggesting it is from the lower blade, towards the tip. It has a curved midrib, creating a biconvex section. The blade edges are abraded and there are no signs of bevels.\n\nThe breaks are consistently patinated and rough, suggesting the breakages occurred shortly before deposition. The breaks have occurred largely straight across the blade and show no signs of casting flaws, inclusions or porosity. The narrower end has a very slight transverse bend (c.3/4 degrees) associated with the break, though there are no other associated marks.\n\nThe fragment is largely covered in an uneven dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, revealing pale brown degradation.\n\n12. Copper alloy casting jet - four runner form\n\nDimensions: top surface length 43.8mm; top surface width 21.4mm; maximum height 32.8mm; depth of pouring reservoir 17.5mm; weight 74.7g.\n\nThis is an oval-shaped jet with four runners, offset from the centre of the pouring reservoir. The reservoir is quite deep and has a rough, uneven upper surface. The underside of one end tapers in with straight sides towards the runners, while the other has more upright and straight sides leading down, shaped by the top of the mould. There is also a small bronze protrusion at the tapering end of the reservoir, while four runners extend from the base. These runners occur as two sets of two. Two are short (c.11mm) and rounded, with a slight split between them. The second pair are longer (17.7mm) and flatter, diverging more greatly, tapering from thick, broad protrusions to narrow stumps.\n\nThe jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.\n\n13. Copper alloy casting jet - two runner form\n\nDimensions: top surface length 27.7mm; top surface width 21mm; maximum height 32.9mm; depth of pouring reservoir 14.1mm; weight 53.5g. \n\nThis a semi-rectangular shaped jet in plan with two runners. The upper surface, of rectangular shape, is straight at the short ends, but tapers slightly in along the longer sides, shaped by the top of the mould. One runner is shorter (7.8mm) with an oval-section. The other runner is broad (17.3mm) and long (19mm) with a D-shaped section.\n\nThe jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.\n\n14. Copper alloy annular ring\n\nDimensions: external diameter 30 x 29.1mm; internal diameter 22 x 22.4mm; bar diameter 3.8 - 4.0mm; weight 4.8g.\n\nThis is a complete circular, annular bronze ring with a circular section.\n\nThe ring is largely covered in a dark brown patina, but the surface has delaminated in patches revealing pale green corrosion.\n\n15. Copper alloy complex circular object - possible vehicle wheel axle fitting or turning cap\n\nDimensions: diameter 52.3mm; height 30mm; height of cylinder c.21mm; internal diameter 25mm; thickness (of base) 9mm; weight 123.7g.\n\nThis is a cast, circular and hollow cylindrical object with a thick outer face and a circular perforation through the centre, with an inset projecting cylinder on the inner face. The margins of the disc, around both external diameter and internal perforation are bevelled, to give a presentable finish. The outer face is thick, heavy and wide, while the walls of the narrower internal cylinder are thinner. Part of the cylinder has broken away on one side. The cylinder tapers in at the centre of the body, before expanding again to a biconical moulding. There is a cast oval perforation through the narrow cylinder wall, while there is an aligning and corresponding curved groove across the underside of the outer disc. This appears to have once held a pin in place, to attach the casting to a larger composite object. The underside surface of the outer disc has diagonally aligned and parallel file or tool marks adjacent to the outer margins, while towards the interior the surface is covered with concentric linear striations, hinting at modern machine finishing.\n\nThe object is covered in a dark green patina.\n\nThis object was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as superficially reminiscent of known chariot or cart fittings of Late Bronze Age and Iron Age date. \n\n16. Copper alloy casting waste - possibly slag\n\nDimensions: length 34.2mm; width 29.0mm; maximum thickness 17.0mm; min thickness 3.0mm; weight 15.4g.\n\nThis is a small, rough piece of casting waste, probably slag, with an uneven surface, caused by the cooling of the metal. The piece is irregularly-shaped and thicker at one end than the other.\n\nThis piece is covered in green corrosion.\n\nThis slag fragment was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as consistent in general characteristics with bronze slag and casting waste associated elsewhere with Late Bronze Age hoards.  | NA                           | 13 | 13 |    NA | ⋯ |  1 | Brecknock Museum              | 23 | Gold         | 10892 | NA            | NA                                                   |   NA |   NA | NA                                                                             |\n| 8 | finds-961742 | 961742 | WMID-349A3E   | FLAT AXEHEAD    | BRONZE AGE | An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).\n\nThe flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 17.1 mm (thickness: 2.0 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are gently curved. The axe is thickest at the mid point (8.6 mm), with no traces of a proto stop ridge present. Potential decoration is present on one side as four circular depressions around the mid point. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 34.3 mm (2.6 mm thick). The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. \n\nIt measures 80.7 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 34.3 mm, width at the butt is 17.1 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 8.6 mm. It weighs 77.7 grams.\n\nThe axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\nReference:\n\nNeedham, S.

AGE | Description:\n\nA folded fragment of a gold strip or ribbon possibly dating to the Middle to Late Bronze Age c. 1500 - 800 BC.  The ribbon is sub-rectangular in plan and made from a sheet of gold. One side of the ribbon is decorated with eight regular, longitudinal, incised grooves. The other side of the ribbon is plain with some light scratches. The ribbon is folded almost half-way down to face the reverse side and folds again at the terminal which has rough damaged edges. The damage is not new. The other end has a neat, flat-ended terminal with sharp 90 degree corners. There is a circular perforation at this end of the ribbon on the fourth and fifth ridge which is slightly off-centre. The diameter of the perforation is 1.1mm. There is an indentation on one edge of the ribbon by the terminal. On the decorated side of the ribbon, the perforation is surrounded by a lip and on the back of the ribbon it is surrounded by a shallow recess indicating that the perforation was punched through from the reverse side. The opposing end of the ribbon is also square-shaped but the edge has been bent over back to rest toward the perforated side of the ribbon. It is a little rough around the edges. There are also some longitudinal scratches and scuff marks on this plain side of the ribbon.\n\nDimensions:\n\nLength: 17.8mm\n\nWidth: 6.6mm\n\nThickness: 3.93\n\nWeight: 1.3g.\n\nDiscussion: \n\nA similar grooved, pierced gold ribbon is recorded under Treasure number 2012 T577 (ESS-C13B97), and other similar types of ribbons include: 2013 T326 (WILT-26F931), 2007 T692 (WAW-C0C0B3), 2014 T63 (BERK-387817), and 2013 T154 (PAS-067AC5).\n\nThe incised linear decoration of the strip can be paralleled on a number of gold strips and 'ribbons' of known and very probable Bronze Age date, particularly the find from Sherborne St John, Hampshire (2013 T154), which also had a single perforation to one and was decorated on only one side. The dimensions and weights of the bands are also comparable. The Tendering strip also bears comparison with gold strips from The Hamel, Oxfordshire (Case 1981; Palmer 1981); Corringham, Lincolnshire (2011 T459); Sproxton, North Yorkshire (2010 T664); Flixton, North Yorkshire (2003 T40a&amp;amp;b); and Ansley, Warwickshire (2007 T672). The find from The Hamel, Oxfordshire, came from the same layer as typologically late Beaker pottery dating to the Early Bronze Age (cf. Needham 2005).\n\nConclusion: Due to the precious metal content of this object being over 10% gold, and it being over 300 years old, this object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the

JEWELLERY       | BRONZE AGE | A complete and unfolded Copper Age basket ornament dated to 2500-2200BC. This item, possibly hair ornaments or ear rings, has been cut from thin gold sheet and would normally have been wrapped into a cylindrical 'basket' shape. This example has been flattened out and shows the full extent of the oval plate which is 38mm long and 16mm wide with semi-circular ends and long straight sides. The interior of the plate is decorated with two concentric lines that run around the outside, inside of this are four zones of about five to six vertical lines running perpendicular to the long edges. This plate is heavily damaged with extensive creasing at either end, plus an off centre crease that runs the length of the plate. Protruding for the centre of one of the long edges is a long and thin (21mm long, 2.5mm wide) tang that would have ultimately been wrapped around the rolled cylindrical plate. As with the plate the tang is heavily creased.\n\nAn almost exact parallel was found in South Oxfordshire 2012 T774 BERK-0D1A05, but also see BERK-F548E6, SUSS-096CEB, LON-FF7E65 and BH-956274\n\nThis class of object belongs to the earliest phases of metallurgy in Britain. These are usually associated with burials and a very rare, dating to the earliest phase of the Bronze Age, c. 2400-2200 BC. Such objects are variously referred to as 'basket ornaments' or 'basket earrings', or 'hair rings'. They are in any case personal ornaments, and have been found in pairs in graves dating to the early Beaker period. Whether worn on hair, ears or items of costume, they were rolled into a basket shape in use.\n\nIn shape and decoration this example falls into Needham's Atlantic Group B (ii) (Needham 2011). Closely similar ornaments were found in Beaker burials at Chilbolton, Hants and Radley 4a, Oxfordshire (Kinnes 1994).

1300 - 1100 BC) flange- or bar-twisted gold torc bent almost in half on itself longitudinally, with breaks at either end. The torc has a cruciform (x-shaped) cross-section with four flanges, although they twist in such a way as to give a circular cross-section around the flanges. The breaks are quite sharp, suggesting they could be quite recent. The bend is not quite at the centre of the object.\nThe ends, both slightly squashed, measure 8.2x6.2mm and 8.4x7.3mm. At these breaks the flanges are c.0.6-0.8mm thick, with a thickened rim (slightly flattened to the outside surface) 0.9-1.0mm thick. At the deepest, the depth between the flanges is c.2.5mm deep. The width/ diameter of the object is relatively parallel and c.9mm.\nThe fragment measures 41.6mm in bent length (unbent it would be c.75mm), 26.8mm in max width and 8.9mm in max.thickness. It weighs 18.24g.

incomplete, probably dating to c. 1300-1150 BC. The object consists of two concavo-convex bands of gold sheet which appear to have been soldered together and curved around to form a loop, the latter left open.\n\nDimensions: diameter 13.9mm; width 7.9mm; thickness 2.3mm; weight 3.26g.\n\nDiscussion: Comparison to other artefacts of the same type would suggest that the present artefact formed the outer cover for a base metal or organic core, along with an inner gold sheet, cf. YORYM-06C5C1, BERK-E2ED60, NMS-ACBFA4 on the PAS database.  \n\nThe penannular ring appears to consist of over 10% precious metal and to be over 300 years old at the time of finding and as such qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.\n\nWil Partridge\nFinds Liaison Officer for Wiltshire\nMarch 2019

      |\n| 15 | finds-941113 | 941113 | WAW-FC5599    | BROOCH          | BRONZE AGE | Brooch of Central European, Bronze Age, type, c.1100-800 BC. It is made from a single length of 2.7mm diameter, copper alloy wire, one end of which is a tightly wound to form a six turn spiral. From this the wire is bent back on itself to form a hook-like catch plate. The wire is twisted back and forth to form five, figure of 8 loops on the end of which is an integral pin. The wire is cracked at this point. The brooch is in excellent condition with a mid-brown patination which contains some grains of sand. Length 99.3mm, Width 41.7mm, Height 26.2mm, Mass 30.31g.\n\nThis brooch is of Central European type and can be closely paralleled by two examples found in a hoard of gold jewellery on the bank of the Danube between Duna-Földvár and Paks in Hungary. This was dated to the 11th to 9th century BC (Hugh Tait, 7000 years of Jewellery, The British Museum, 2006, 51, plate 108). A further parallel is provided by an example in Merseyside Museums which is provenance as 'Northern Hungary' (Susan Nicholson, Catalogue of the Prehistoric Metalwork in the Merseyside County Museums, Merseyside County Council, Liverpool,, 1980, 70, No. 141.\n\nWhile it is not impossible for this object to have found its way to England in antiquity its condition, and the fact that it was a surface find, suggest that it may be a recent import, perhaps coming from a European collection during the Second World War and, its significance unrecognised, subsequently lost.

Cast pentagonal-section strip, broken at one end and flattened to spatulate form at the other. The section is angular, with two low and probably worn facets on what is taken to have been the display or outer face, producing a gently keeled appearance. This is carried along the object to the spatulate end, which may therefore be regarded as a deliberately fashioned terminal to a penannular and probably symmetrical form, with its equivalent now lost. The object is now curved with two sharper and one more gentle bends, with two cracks near the latter. The finder kindly notes that the curved parts near the flat terminal and towards the other end of the object both fit snugly against the wrist if the keeled face is set outwards, though of course the object may as easily be worn around the neck. The finder also notes the object has been tested - presumably non-destructively - and its material confirmed as 'pure gold'. Extensive search around the find spot has yet to reveal the missing fragment. Suggested date: Late Bronze Age, 1000-800 BC\n\nGiven its age and material the object is to be subjected to the Treasure process, Ref. 2019 T188. Its association with other Bronze Age finds reported from the vicinity also commends it as a 'find of note'.\n\nLength: 127mm, Width: 18.4mm, Thickness: 3.4mm, Weight: 48.58gms

finds-940073 | 940073 | NLM-572E82    | SPEAR           | BRONZE AGE | Copper alloy spear head. Cast pegged and socketed spearhead, retaining the end of a wooden shaft within, which is now pale brown in colour and fibrous in its appearance. The spearhead takes the form of a regular cone with opposed flanges forming blades which extend from the pointed tip for 71mm, or to 21mm above the mouth of the socket. Opposed drilled holes are set 9.4mm, or half way between socket and flanges, and are aligned with them. One of these holes is of 4mm diameter; the other retains the burred head of a rivet of diameter 4.4mm. Three finely incised circumferential lines immediately below them may have served to set out the holes. Above them, a zig-zag pattern of elongated dots - or perhaps dashes given the form - produces a series of six triangles between the rivet holes and a seventh carried over the occupied hole, with each triangle of height 4mm. A further two circumferential lines of dots are carried around the socket mouth below the triplicated continuous lines.\n\nThe outer cutting edges of the blades are lightly abraded, showing a green tint against an overall brown patina, and along with limited abrasions on one side of the object these are the only indications of deterioration or damage. As with other objects of the period hereabouts, the spearhead appears to have been deposited in working order. The practice of ritual 'killing' of an object does not seem to figure here.\n\nThe triplicate decoration combined with zig-zag motifs recurs in WAW-C65A09, a spearhead recently reported from Warwickshire. That example is held to be of later Bronze Age date, 1150-600 BC. In this case, the relative proportions of blade and socket are different, with more blade and less socket. A stubby peg-hole spearhead from Burton on Stather, North Lincolnshire, displayed in the North Lincolnshire Museum, more closely resembles this example, and is ascribed to the Early Bronze Age, probably c.1600BC or thereafter.\n\nSuggested date: Middle to Late Bronze age, 1600-800 BC\n\nLength: 94mm, Width (at blade): 24.5mm, Diameter (socket): 22.6mm, Thickness (wall, at mouth of socket):

from decorated gold sheet around a copper alloy core. The ring is oval in plan with a triangular cross-sectional profile. The face has a pronounced midrib and eight smaller concentric ribs running around either side of the face (17 ribs in total) suggesting construction from gold wire, in contrast to the gold sheeting of the inner surface and terminals which is flat and undecorated. The opening in the ring has been damaged, with the gold plate broken to reveal the corroded copper alloy core. One of the terminals has split and been pushed back inside the ring, with the sheeting ruptured; there is additional crushing damage to one side of the ring which has ruptured the sheeting on the

|\n| 19 | finds-935510 | 935510 | SUSS-5B32DE   | PENANNULAR RING | BRONZE AGE | A complete, gold-plated Late Bronze Age (1150-800 BC) penannular ring. The ring is in the shape of an oval-sectioned loop. Many of these penannular rings have a copper alloy core wrapped in gold sheet; however, it is not entirely clear if this is the case for this example, as there are to chips or brakes showing the core.\n\nThere are many examples of these objects recorded in the PAS database. Some of these include: BH-719492 (2018 T761), PAS-011055 (2016 T920), KENT-FF00A6 (2018 T376) and HAMP-425F0D (2018 T89).\n\nThese penannular rings are sometimes known as 'ring-money' or 'hair rings' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008) [References from NMGW-04216C]. The function of these objects remain relatively unknown, having been possibly identified as currency for exchange, or ornaments worn by people to display wealth and power.

is&amp;nbsp;snipped (in a pincer-like or &amp;lsquo;chisel-cut&amp;rsquo; way) on either end. The object has a sub-hexagonal cross-section. \n\nDimensions: Length: 18mm; Width: 6mm; Thickness: 4.5mm; Weight: 4.32g \n\nMetal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of a gold bar fragment by the British Museum, indicated a surface composition of approximately 81-83% gold, 14-16% silver, the rest being largely copper. See appended report. \n\nDiscussion: This fragment is similar in appearance &amp;ndash; and, perhaps most notably, style of pincer-like cut &amp;ndash; to the fragments from the Middle Bronze Age hoard from Fittleworth hoard (of 42 objects), also found in West Sussex (see Treasure Trove Reviewing Committee Annual Report 1996-1997 p.7-8, no.1, now in the British museum registration BEP 1996, 0902.1ff). In particular, comparison can be made with fragments BEP 1996, 0902.1-3. \n\nNon-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis&amp;nbsp;indicated a surface composition of approximately 81-83% gold, 14-16% silver, the rest being largely copper.&amp;nbsp;This&amp;nbsp;composition is consistent with a Bronze Age date. \n\nConclusion: On the balance of probabilities, this object qualifies as Treasure under the Treasure Act (1996), by virtue of being of prehistoric date and comprising of more than 10% precious metal.

Age period (c. BC 2350 - c. BC 2050).\\&nbsp;\nThe axe is broadly rectangular in plan with a slightly splayed crescentric blade. In profile and in section the object is broadly lentoid.\nThe sides of the axe gently taper outwards with a shallow curve, from the rounded butt to the blade. The curve is less shallow towards the blade. The axehead has suffered significant loss from corrosion on all surfaces, particularly at the blade and the butt.\nThe axehead measures 67.4 mm in length, the butt is 18.1 mm wide and the blade measures 27.3 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 3.8 mm, the ridge measures 10.9 mm thick and the blade is 2.1 mm thick. The axehead weighs 59 g.\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham\\&\\#39;s (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL.\\&nbsp;BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\nReference:\n\nNeedham, S.

PAS-35C8A8    & RIBBON          & BRONZE AGE & Folded gold strip or diadem. Soil remains wedged between layers. The object has been folded up and consists of 5-6 layers. The tapering tip of one end of the strip is visible on the outside of the folded bundle. Lines of pointillé decoration run along both edges of the strip and meet at the terminal. There are three perforations visible on a terminal of the band that tapers inwards forming a triangle with the single perforation at the tip of the taper en\n\nDimensions (in folded condition):\n\nLength: 28.23mm\nWidth: 19.93mm\nThickness (with soil): 5.33mm\n\nThickness (sheet): 0.18mm\nWeight (with soil): 8.55g\n\nMetal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the strip (undertaken at the British Museum) indicated a surface composition of approximately 92-94\\% gold and 6-8\\% silver, the rest (less than 1\\%) being copper. (See appended report).\n\nCurators note: this is a very similar composition to the very similar band from Berinsfield, South Oxfordshire (Treasure case 2016 T521).\n\nDiscussion: Of Early Bronze Age date (c.2500 - 1500 BC), and now in two pieces, this is only the fifth or sixth example of this type of object from Britain. These objects are rare and are not yet fully understood; it is likely to date from the earliest Bronze Age / Chacolithic period, c. 2500-2200 BC and as such is part of a select group of objects that represent the earliest gold objects in Britain.\n\nThe function or what object this mount decorated is not certain; suggestions include scabbard fittings, diadem or neck choker/band, or perhaps a decorative strip attached to leather. A similar object was reported as Treasure in 2005, case number 2005T21 (from 'near Winchester' - the provenance is vague - acquired by the British Museum: 2008, 8019.1) (Needham \\&amp; Sheridan 2014, 908-9). The 'near Winchester' find also has three perforations set within the terminals in a similar fashion to a recently reported item from Stratford-Upon-Avon (Treasure case 2016 T209), and Berinsfield, South Oxfordshire (Treasure case 2016 T521).

& FLAT AXEHEAD    & BRONZE AGE & Incomplete cast copper alloy miniature flat axehead, sub-triangular in plan, and slightly lozenge-shaped in profile, with an undeveloped, straight-sided blade that has worn to a curve on one side. From the blade the axe tapers to a narrow rounded butt end, that is 14 mm wide. The sides of the blade expand slightly and meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 27 mm. The curve of the blade suggests that it was not probably used as an axehead but instead perhaps buried as a representation of a larger functional axehead at a time when bronze was too valuable to bury. The length of the flat axe is only 76 mm so it less than half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.\n\nSee CORN-7ACDD7 for a similar miniature flat axehead that is dated from 2200-2000 BC.\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axehead on page 502, plate 69, no.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, which is associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.\n\nCowie \\&amp; O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin \\&amp; Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axehead with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.\n\nSchmidt \\&amp; Burgess (1981) illustrate similar unclassified miniature flat axeheads with worn blades in pl.22, nos.266 \\&amp; 283.\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\nNeedham, S.

AXEHEAD    & BRONZE AGE & An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).\n\nThe flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with an incomplete rounded shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 12.0 mm (thickness: 2.4 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. The axe is thickest at the mid point (6.0 mm), with no sign of a proto stop ridge. The sides of the blade expand to produce a rounded blade edge with an abraded width of 34.4 mm (thickness 3.6 mm). \n\nThe axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\nIt measures 72.5 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 34.4 mm, width at the butt is 12.0 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 6.0 mm. It weighs 48.6 grams.\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\nReference:\n\nNeedham, S.

From the blade the axe tapers to a narrow rounded butt end, that is 14 mm wide. The sides of the blade do not expand but meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 29 mm. The curve of the blade suggests that it was not probably used as an axehead but instead perhaps buried as a representation of a larger functional axehead at a time when bronze was too valuable to bury. The length of the flat axe is only 83 mm so it less than half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.\n\nSee CORN-7ACDD7 for a similar miniature flat axehead that is dated from 2200-2000 BC.\n\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axehead on page 502, plate 69, no.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, which is associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.\n\nCowie \\&amp; O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin \\&amp; Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axehead with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.\n\nSchmidt \\&amp; Burgess (1981) illustrate similar unclassified miniature flat axeheads with worn blades in pl.22, nos.266 \\&amp; 283.\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.

LANCUM-C6B5FC & TORC            & BRONZE AGE & Solid gold armring with punched decoration. The armring is circular in section and curves in an oval shape, with overlapping terminals. Shallow punched dots cover the outer three quarters of the object. These measure approximately 1.44mm in diameter and are tightly clustered, with some overlap. There is noticeable wear to the outer edge of the object as the surface is smoother and the punched dots are much shallower.\n\nLength: 82.09mm\n\nWidth: 68.57mm\n\nDiameter: 11.55mm\n\nWeight: 311g\n\n\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe armring is similar in form to those of the Tullydonnell hoard from County Donegal, which were dated to c. 1200 - 800 BC. A direct parallel with punched decoration is known from Trimblestown Castle, County Meath, which is now in the collections of the National Museum of Ireland (Armstrong, E. C. R. (1920) Guide to the Collection of Irish Antiquities, p. 94, no. 412, pl. XVIII, no. 392). This was dated to c. 800 - 700 BC. The object is also paralleled by a larger example from The Lee, Buckinghamshire, recorded as a bracelet (Treasure Trove case no. 315 from 199/4, now in Buckinghamshire County Museum, Wendover). A small scale excavation at the findspot of the bracelet recovered no evidence of a feature or container but it was noted that the object came from the ploughsoil and may have been disturbed (Treasure Trove file, British Museum archive). Unlike the object under discussion, the punched dotted decoration on The Leeexample extended across the terminals. Similar punched decoration also appears on gold plated base metal late Bronze Age penannular rings (sometimes called bullae) of Lough Gara type (Ibid., p. 93, nos 404 - 406). Given the paucity of examples known, it is unclear whether this armring is an Irish or British type.\n\n\n\nAuthors:

Gold penannular bar bracelet fragment - Type 4B \n\nDimensions: surviving length 25.7mm; bar width 5.7mm; bar thickness 4mm; head width 9.8mm; head thickness 8.3mm; weight 7.36g.\n\nThis is a terminal fragment of a gold bar bracelet with a D-shape section. The bar expands abruptly to a solid, outwardly expanding flat terminal, also with a D-section. On the flat terminal face there is a slight penannular shaped hollow 0.5-1.0mm wide running around the sides and outer margins of the terminal. This is inset parallel with and approximately 0.5mm from the outer edge of the terminal face. The bar has been deliberately broken pre-deposition with a 'pinched' break, suggesting it was chiselled or cut, rather than bent and snapped. There is also one chisel mark on the flat face of the bar, which is close to the break and likely represents a failed impact mark. There are numerous and pronounced dents and impressed tool marks on the surface of the bracelet, which appear to be ancient, linked either with the forming of the bracelet or representing deliberate damage to the bracelet immediately prior to burial of the hoard.\n\n2. Copper alloy pin head or bracelet terminal fragment\n\nDimensions: surviving length 20.2mm; shaft diameter (below head) 4.8 x 5.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.6 x 3.2mm; surviving head depth 11.5mm; surviving head width 10.2mm; weight 2.33g.\n\nThis is a fragment of a circular-section bar of bronze that expands at one end to an incomplete terminal or head. The head/terminal is concave with a convex underside and was probably originally circular. Below the head/terminal the shaft is appears to have been decorated with at least three horizontal ribs, which are now very worn and shallow, and separated by at least two shallow grooves. The shaft appears to taper slightly, but degradation to the surface makes this difficult to discern.\n\nFragmentation has occurred around the circumference of the head/terminal so no original edge survives, and the object has broken across the bar/shaft in prehistory. This breakage is coupled with damage to the surface of the bronze, which is consistently patinated. The object is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges.\n\n3. Copper alloy penannular bracelet terminal fragment (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 4)\n\nDimensions: surviving curved length 35.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.4 x 2.7mm; surviving head diameter 9.3x8.1mm; weight 3.23g.\n\nThis is a fragment of a bracelet with a circular-section bar, gently expanding to a roughly oval terminal. The terminal is incomplete, and there is a prominent lateral ridge down the otherwise flat terminal. This ridge may be casting flash. The overall piece is curved, indicating it once formed part of a bracelet. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 4, below, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established, as the break points on both fragments are worn and eroded.\n\nThere are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, particularly around the terminal, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.\n\n4. Copper alloy incomplete possible bracelet (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 3)\n\nDimensions: bent length 45mm; maximum bar diameter 4.3x5mm; min. bar diameter 3.6x1.8mm; weight 7.6g.\n\nThis is a bronze bar, bent into a rough U-shape, with a rounded section, now heavily eroded so as to be inconsistent in diameter and section shape along the length. Where original surfaces survive, there is an angular, slightly projecting casting flash evident on both interior and exterior sides of the hoop. Both ends are broken, though one expands slightly, which might indicate this was approaching a terminal end. At one point, the bar has been deliberately and differentially bent out of shape, compressing the surviving ends out of shape and towards each other. At the point of bending, the bar is thin and compressed. The breakages at each end are worn and abraded. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 3, above, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established.\n\nThere are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.\n\n5. Copper alloy socketed axe - Slender faceted axe of Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham / Class D \n\nDimensions: maximum surviving length 91.2mm; maximum width cutting edge 51.1mm; external socket diameter (width x depth) 31.5 x 28.2mm; internal socket diameter (width x depth) 22.8 x 20.6mm; depth of collar 16.2mm; width of body below loop 27.2mm; depth of socket 62.6mm; weight 110.8g.\n\nThis is a near complete copper alloy socketed axe with an oval shaped socket mouth and a slender upper body that flares to a broad cutting edge. The body is roughly hexagonal in section, with two narrow and not particularly defined facets down each face margin. The socket mouth is flat and the collar is plain and flared. The base of the collar is defined by a prominent raised horizontal rib moulding, flanked by a shallow, poorly formed groove above and below. On the lower side, there is a second and poorly defined rib moulding, showing as a parallel raised ridge, beneath which the narrow facets originate. The rib moulding is straight on one face, but curved and irregular on the opposite face. The loop emerges below the collar and is of modest width. The faces of the axe are undecorated, with the exception of the facets, defined by grooves on each side of each face, starting from below the collar and following the shape of the axe. These grooves are shallow and poorly formed, stopping as the blade is expanding; the longest extends for 42.6mm.\n\nThe sides of the axe diverge greatly towards the cutting edge, creating a broad edge. The original cutting edge no longer survives and has fragmented unevenly, but was probably originally straight. One face of the axe has been worked to approximately 4.5mm above the surviving edge, though the opposite face shows limited signs of preparation. The blade appears to have been hammered out on the worked face, so the shape of the lower blade is asymmetrical; one half is almost crinoline in form, while the other simply flares out. This could be the result of hammering or a fault in the mould. There are numerous short horizontal striation marks across the worked face of the lower blade, which likely relate to sharpening or working activities, and in sections there are also vertical striations. The opposite face has a few macroscopic horizontal striations.\n\nThe molten bronze appears to have been cast in around the interior of the socket mouth, with two slightly raised lumps on the mouth identifiable as possible runner stumps. The casting seams down either side of the axe survive as raised, blunt ridges, but seem to have been hammered down. The slightly off-centre line of these seams indicates the axe was cast in slightly mismatched mould halves. On the no-loop side, there is a linear groove running beside the casting seam, suggesting an imperfection in the shaping of the mould. There are also three holes in the upper body and collar of the axe, which are casting defects where the metal has not filled the mould completely. An oval hole (7.7 x 5.4mm) is present in the flared section of the collar on the opposite side of the axe to the side loop. On the opposite face of the axe are two linearly aligned oval holes, one in the gap by the loop (c.4.5 x 7.7mm), and one about 5mm above it (4.1 x 6mm).\n\nThe axe is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, mottled with tan and orange patches. The socket mouth has suffered some minor material loss, which shows a small patch of green corrosion product forming, as does the fragmentary cutting edge.\n\n6. 7. and 8. Copper alloy socketed axe fragments - Type Croxton (conjoining fragments)\n\nDimensions: surviving length of No.6 54.9mm; surviving length of No.7 42.3mm; surviving length of No.8 24.8mm; external socket width 48.5mm; internal socket width 38.5mm; maximum collar depth 12.7mm; width of body below loop 38.2mm; width of No.7 18.8mm; width of No.8 24.4mm; weight No.6 76.7g; weight No.7 11.3g; weight No.8 9.2g; combined weight 97.1g.\n\nThese are three refitting fragments of an incomplete upper body of a ribbed socketed axe. The larger fragment (No.6) consists of one face of the upper body of a socketed axe, including the socket and collar, side loop, and upper part of the body bearing three vertical ribs. The second fragment (No.7) is much smaller and refits on the non-loop side, bearing part of the opposite face with two of the three ribs. The third fragment (No.8) is a small part of the socket mouth and moulding on the loop side, that forms an imperfect but probable refit with No. 6 and with very closely similar characteristics (e.g. the form and width of the collar, the same patina and unworn break edges), so that it can be concluded it was once part of the same axe. The area of refit between Nos. 6 and 8 indicates that there was some material loss during the breakage (e.g. a small section of metal) which would explain why these two fragments do not refit perfectly. The axe has split vertically down the socket, as well as across the body about 16.4mm below the side loop. \n\nThe socket end (visible on fragments 6 \\&amp; 8) is defined by a flat-topped mouth, with a wide and plain onset collar with straight and slightly everted sides. Three parallel lateral raised ribs extend from the base of the collar (fragment 6) and terminate below the point of breakage, though do not converge. Two of these have worn down or damaged. The surviving socket indicates it was originally sub-rectangular with rounded corners and the body was broadly hexagonal, with angular face edges. A narrow loop descends from the base of the collar, with the external casting seam on the loop placed off centre. Prominent raised casting seams are present on both sides of the axe fragment, though are blunt, suggesting they have been hammered down.\n\nFragment No.7 represents the corner of the upper body of the axe and part of the face with two lateral raised ribs. Fragment No.8 represents the corner of a flat-topped socket mouth,\n\nwith a deep onset collar moulding of identical proportions to No.6. The possible remains of a worn runner stump are visible on the mouth of fragment No. 8. This fragment has broken unevenly along three sides.\n\nAll fragments are largely covered in a dark brown patina, but this has delaminated in patches around the socket collar and along the ribs, leaving tan and pale green corrosion. All of the breakages along the sides, socket and body are soil covered, but not significantly eroded and retaining localised angularities along the breaks, suggesting that the breaks occurred while buried, rather than during retrieval.\n\n9. Probable small face wall fragment of a ribbed socketed axe (probably part of Croxton Type socketed axe No. 6-8)\n\nDimensions: length 16.1mm; width 9.0mm; thickness 2.1mm; weight 1.27g.\n\nThis is a small, thin fragment of bronze, broken along all edges in antiquity. On one face, adjacent to a break line, there is a straight linear ridge, consistent with a decorative rib from the face of a ribbed socketed axe. The wall thickness of 2.1mm evident on this fragment is also consistent with the range of wall thicknesses seen on bronze socketed axes. One corner of this bronze fragment has been distorted, suggesting impact damage at some point, either in antiquity or more recent times.\n\nThere is a small patch of dark brown patina surviving on both faces at one end, though the original surface has delaminated from the rest of the object revealing pale green corrosion.\n\n10. Copper alloy spearhead fragment - probably Group 11\n\nDimensions: surviving length 47.7mm; width at breakage 22.3mm; depth at breakage (across midrib) 7mm; thickness at tip 6.2mm; weight 14.5g.\n\nThis is a tip fragment of a socketed spearhead, broken unevenly in antiquity. It has a low, rounded midrib, and thick narrow blade wings, creating a pointed ovate section. The edge is abraded, making it difficult to determine the original form of the blade, but the slender nature of the tip indicates it may have been flame-shaped. The surviving tip is thick and blunt.\n\nThe spearhead seems to have broken pre-deposition across the upper blade, below the internal socket aperture. There is still material embedded in the socket, making it unclear how much further the socket extends. The break is uneven as one blade wing survives more than the other.\n\nThe fragment is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, particularly on the midrib, revealing green corrosion.\n\n11. Copper alloy blade fragment - probable sword\n\nDimensions: surviving length 76.7mm; width at breaks 19.6 and 28.7mm; thickness at breaks 5.6 and 7.5mm; weight 66.3g.\n\nThis is a narrow fragment of a blade, broken at both ends. The blade tapers to one end, suggesting it is from the lower blade, towards the tip. It has a curved midrib, creating a biconvex section. The blade edges are abraded and there are no signs of bevels.\n\nThe breaks are consistently patinated and rough, suggesting the breakages occurred shortly before deposition. The breaks have occurred largely straight across the blade and show no signs of casting flaws, inclusions or porosity. The narrower end has a very slight transverse bend (c.3/4 degrees) associated with the break, though there are no other associated marks.\n\nThe fragment is largely covered in an uneven dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, revealing pale brown degradation.\n\n12. Copper alloy casting jet - four runner form\n\nDimensions: top surface length 43.8mm; top surface width 21.4mm; maximum height 32.8mm; depth of pouring reservoir 17.5mm; weight 74.7g.\n\nThis is an oval-shaped jet with four runners, offset from the centre of the pouring reservoir. The reservoir is quite deep and has a rough, uneven upper surface. The underside of one end tapers in with straight sides towards the runners, while the other has more upright and straight sides leading down, shaped by the top of the mould. There is also a small bronze protrusion at the tapering end of the reservoir, while four runners extend from the base. These runners occur as two sets of two. Two are short (c.11mm) and rounded, with a slight split between them. The second pair are longer (17.7mm) and flatter, diverging more greatly, tapering from thick, broad protrusions to narrow stumps.\n\nThe jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.\n\n13. Copper alloy casting jet - two runner form\n\nDimensions: top surface length 27.7mm; top surface width 21mm; maximum height 32.9mm; depth of pouring reservoir 14.1mm; weight 53.5g. \n\nThis a semi-rectangular shaped jet in plan with two runners. The upper surface, of rectangular shape, is straight at the short ends, but tapers slightly in along the longer sides, shaped by the top of the mould. One runner is shorter (7.8mm) with an oval-section. The other runner is broad (17.3mm) and long (19mm) with a D-shaped section.\n\nThe jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.\n\n14. Copper alloy annular ring\n\nDimensions: external diameter 30 x 29.1mm; internal diameter 22 x 22.4mm; bar diameter 3.8 - 4.0mm; weight 4.8g.\n\nThis is a complete circular, annular bronze ring with a circular section.\n\nThe ring is largely covered in a dark brown patina, but the surface has delaminated in patches revealing pale green corrosion.\n\n15. Copper alloy complex circular object - possible vehicle wheel axle fitting or turning cap\n\nDimensions: diameter 52.3mm; height 30mm; height of cylinder c.21mm; internal diameter 25mm; thickness (of base) 9mm; weight 123.7g.\n\nThis is a cast, circular and hollow cylindrical object with a thick outer face and a circular perforation through the centre, with an inset projecting cylinder on the inner face. The margins of the disc, around both external diameter and internal perforation are bevelled, to give a presentable finish. The outer face is thick, heavy and wide, while the walls of the narrower internal cylinder are thinner. Part of the cylinder has broken away on one side. The cylinder tapers in at the centre of the body, before expanding again to a biconical moulding. There is a cast oval perforation through the narrow cylinder wall, while there is an aligning and corresponding curved groove across the underside of the outer disc. This appears to have once held a pin in place, to attach the casting to a larger composite object. The underside surface of the outer disc has diagonally aligned and parallel file or tool marks adjacent to the outer margins, while towards the interior the surface is covered with concentric linear striations, hinting at modern machine finishing.\n\nThe object is covered in a dark green patina.\n\nThis object was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as superficially reminiscent of known chariot or cart fittings of Late Bronze Age and Iron Age date. \n\n16. Copper alloy casting waste - possibly slag\n\nDimensions: length 34.2mm; width 29.0mm; maximum thickness 17.0mm; min thickness 3.0mm; weight 15.4g.\n\nThis is a small, rough piece of casting waste, probably slag, with an uneven surface, caused by the cooling of the metal. The piece is irregularly-shaped and thicker at one end than the other.\n\nThis piece is covered in green corrosion.\n\nThis slag fragment was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as consistent in general characteristics with bronze slag and casting waste associated elsewhere with Late Bronze Age hoards.  & NA                           & 13 & 13 &    NA & ⋯ &  1 & Brecknock Museum              & 23 & Gold         & 10892 & NA            & NA                                                   &   NA &   NA & NA                                                                            \\\\\n\t8 & finds-961742 & 961742 & WMID-349A3E   & FLAT AXEHEAD    & BRONZE AGE & An incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).\n\nThe flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 17.1 mm (thickness: 2.0 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are gently curved. The axe is thickest at the mid point (8.6 mm), with no traces of a proto stop ridge present. Potential decoration is present on one side as four circular depressions around the mid point. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 34.3 mm (2.6 mm thick). The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. \n\nIt measures 80.7 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 34.3 mm, width at the butt is 17.1 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 8.6 mm. It weighs 77.7 grams.\n\nThe axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\n\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).\n\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n\nReference:\n\nNeedham, S.

BRONZE AGE & Description:\n\nA folded fragment of a gold strip or ribbon possibly dating to the Middle to Late Bronze Age c. 1500 - 800 BC.  The ribbon is sub-rectangular in plan and made from a sheet of gold. One side of the ribbon is decorated with eight regular, longitudinal, incised grooves. The other side of the ribbon is plain with some light scratches. The ribbon is folded almost half-way down to face the reverse side and folds again at the terminal which has rough damaged edges. The damage is not new. The other end has a neat, flat-ended terminal with sharp 90 degree corners. There is a circular perforation at this end of the ribbon on the fourth and fifth ridge which is slightly off-centre. The diameter of the perforation is 1.1mm. There is an indentation on one edge of the ribbon by the terminal. On the decorated side of the ribbon, the perforation is surrounded by a lip and on the back of the ribbon it is surrounded by a shallow recess indicating that the perforation was punched through from the reverse side. The opposing end of the ribbon is also square-shaped but the edge has been bent over back to rest toward the perforated side of the ribbon. It is a little rough around the edges. There are also some longitudinal scratches and scuff marks on this plain side of the ribbon.\n\nDimensions:\n\nLength: 17.8mm\n\nWidth: 6.6mm\n\nThickness: 3.93\n\nWeight: 1.3g.\n\nDiscussion: \n\nA similar grooved, pierced gold ribbon is recorded under Treasure number 2012 T577 (ESS-C13B97), and other similar types of ribbons include: 2013 T326 (WILT-26F931), 2007 T692 (WAW-C0C0B3), 2014 T63 (BERK-387817), and 2013 T154 (PAS-067AC5).\n\nThe incised linear decoration of the strip can be paralleled on a number of gold strips and 'ribbons' of known and very probable Bronze Age date, particularly the find from Sherborne St John, Hampshire (2013 T154), which also had a single perforation to one and was decorated on only one side. The dimensions and weights of the bands are also comparable. The Tendering strip also bears comparison with gold strips from The Hamel, Oxfordshire (Case 1981; Palmer 1981); Corringham, Lincolnshire (2011 T459); Sproxton, North Yorkshire (2010 T664); Flixton, North Yorkshire (2003 T40a\\&amp;b); and Ansley, Warwickshire (2007 T672). The find from The Hamel, Oxfordshire, came from the same layer as typologically late Beaker pottery dating to the Early Bronze Age (cf. Needham 2005).\n\nConclusion: Due to the precious metal content of this object being over 10\\% gold, and it being over 300 years old, this object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.

JEWELLERY       & BRONZE AGE & A complete and unfolded Copper Age basket ornament dated to 2500-2200BC. This item, possibly hair ornaments or ear rings, has been cut from thin gold sheet and would normally have been wrapped into a cylindrical 'basket' shape. This example has been flattened out and shows the full extent of the oval plate which is 38mm long and 16mm wide with semi-circular ends and long straight sides. The interior of the plate is decorated with two concentric lines that run around the outside, inside of this are four zones of about five to six vertical lines running perpendicular to the long edges. This plate is heavily damaged with extensive creasing at either end, plus an off centre crease that runs the length of the plate. Protruding for the centre of one of the long edges is a long and thin (21mm long, 2.5mm wide) tang that would have ultimately been wrapped around the rolled cylindrical plate. As with the plate the tang is heavily creased.\n\nAn almost exact parallel was found in South Oxfordshire 2012 T774 BERK-0D1A05, but also see BERK-F548E6, SUSS-096CEB, LON-FF7E65 and BH-956274\n\nThis class of object belongs to the earliest phases of metallurgy in Britain. These are usually associated with burials and a very rare, dating to the earliest phase of the Bronze Age, c. 2400-2200 BC. Such objects are variously referred to as 'basket ornaments' or 'basket earrings', or 'hair rings'. They are in any case personal ornaments, and have been found in pairs in graves dating to the early Beaker period. Whether worn on hair, ears or items of costume, they were rolled into a basket shape in use.\n\nIn shape and decoration this example falls into Needham's Atlantic Group B (ii) (Needham 2011). Closely similar ornaments were found in Beaker burials at Chilbolton, Hants and Radley 4a, Oxfordshire (Kinnes 1994).

1300 - 1100 BC) flange- or bar-twisted gold torc bent almost in half on itself longitudinally, with breaks at either end. The torc has a cruciform (x-shaped) cross-section with four flanges, although they twist in such a way as to give a circular cross-section around the flanges. The breaks are quite sharp, suggesting they could be quite recent. The bend is not quite at the centre of the object.\nThe ends, both slightly squashed, measure 8.2x6.2mm and 8.4x7.3mm. At these breaks the flanges are c.0.6-0.8mm thick, with a thickened rim (slightly flattened to the outside surface) 0.9-1.0mm thick. At the deepest, the depth between the flanges is c.2.5mm deep. The width/ diameter of the object is relatively parallel and c.9mm.\nThe fragment measures 41.6mm in bent length (unbent it would be c.75mm), 26.8mm in max width and 8.9mm in max.thickness. It weighs 18.24g.

possibly incomplete, probably dating to c. 1300-1150 BC. The object consists of two concavo-convex bands of gold sheet which appear to have been soldered together and curved around to form a loop, the latter left open.\n\nDimensions: diameter 13.9mm; width 7.9mm; thickness 2.3mm; weight 3.26g.\n\nDiscussion: Comparison to other artefacts of the same type would suggest that the present artefact formed the outer cover for a base metal or organic core, along with an inner gold sheet, cf. YORYM-06C5C1, BERK-E2ED60, NMS-ACBFA4 on the PAS database.  \n\nThe penannular ring appears to consist of over 10\\% precious metal and to be over 300 years old at the time of finding and as such qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.\n\nWil Partridge\nFinds Liaison Officer for Wiltshire\nMarch 2019

     \\\\\n\t15 & finds-941113 & 941113 & WAW-FC5599    & BROOCH          & BRONZE AGE & Brooch of Central European, Bronze Age, type, c.1100-800 BC. It is made from a single length of 2.7mm diameter, copper alloy wire, one end of which is a tightly wound to form a six turn spiral. From this the wire is bent back on itself to form a hook-like catch plate. The wire is twisted back and forth to form five, figure of 8 loops on the end of which is an integral pin. The wire is cracked at this point. The brooch is in excellent condition with a mid-brown patination which contains some grains of sand. Length 99.3mm, Width 41.7mm, Height 26.2mm, Mass 30.31g.\n\nThis brooch is of Central European type and can be closely paralleled by two examples found in a hoard of gold jewellery on the bank of the Danube between Duna-Földvár and Paks in Hungary. This was dated to the 11th to 9th century BC (Hugh Tait, 7000 years of Jewellery, The British Museum, 2006, 51, plate 108). A further parallel is provided by an example in Merseyside Museums which is provenance as 'Northern Hungary' (Susan Nicholson, Catalogue of the Prehistoric Metalwork in the Merseyside County Museums, Merseyside County Council, Liverpool,, 1980, 70, No. 141.\n\nWhile it is not impossible for this object to have found its way to England in antiquity its condition, and the fact that it was a surface find, suggest that it may be a recent import, perhaps coming from a European collection during the Second World War and, its significance unrecognised, subsequently lost.

Cast pentagonal-section strip, broken at one end and flattened to spatulate form at the other. The section is angular, with two low and probably worn facets on what is taken to have been the display or outer face, producing a gently keeled appearance. This is carried along the object to the spatulate end, which may therefore be regarded as a deliberately fashioned terminal to a penannular and probably symmetrical form, with its equivalent now lost. The object is now curved with two sharper and one more gentle bends, with two cracks near the latter. The finder kindly notes that the curved parts near the flat terminal and towards the other end of the object both fit snugly against the wrist if the keeled face is set outwards, though of course the object may as easily be worn around the neck. The finder also notes the object has been tested - presumably non-destructively - and its material confirmed as 'pure gold'. Extensive search around the find spot has yet to reveal the missing fragment. Suggested date: Late Bronze Age, 1000-800 BC\n\nGiven its age and material the object is to be subjected to the Treasure process, Ref. 2019 T188. Its association with other Bronze Age finds reported from the vicinity also commends it as a 'find of note'.\n\nLength: 127mm, Width: 18.4mm, Thickness: 3.4mm, Weight: 48.58gms

finds-940073 & 940073 & NLM-572E82    & SPEAR           & BRONZE AGE & Copper alloy spear head. Cast pegged and socketed spearhead, retaining the end of a wooden shaft within, which is now pale brown in colour and fibrous in its appearance. The spearhead takes the form of a regular cone with opposed flanges forming blades which extend from the pointed tip for 71mm, or to 21mm above the mouth of the socket. Opposed drilled holes are set 9.4mm, or half way between socket and flanges, and are aligned with them. One of these holes is of 4mm diameter; the other retains the burred head of a rivet of diameter 4.4mm. Three finely incised circumferential lines immediately below them may have served to set out the holes. Above them, a zig-zag pattern of elongated dots - or perhaps dashes given the form - produces a series of six triangles between the rivet holes and a seventh carried over the occupied hole, with each triangle of height 4mm. A further two circumferential lines of dots are carried around the socket mouth below the triplicated continuous lines.\n\nThe outer cutting edges of the blades are lightly abraded, showing a green tint against an overall brown patina, and along with limited abrasions on one side of the object these are the only indications of deterioration or damage. As with other objects of the period hereabouts, the spearhead appears to have been deposited in working order. The practice of ritual 'killing' of an object does not seem to figure here.\n\nThe triplicate decoration combined with zig-zag motifs recurs in WAW-C65A09, a spearhead recently reported from Warwickshire. That example is held to be of later Bronze Age date, 1150-600 BC. In this case, the relative proportions of blade and socket are different, with more blade and less socket. A stubby peg-hole spearhead from Burton on Stather, North Lincolnshire, displayed in the North Lincolnshire Museum, more closely resembles this example, and is ascribed to the Early Bronze Age, probably c.1600BC or thereafter.\n\nSuggested date: Middle to Late Bronze age, 1600-800 BC\n\nLength: 94mm, Width (at blade): 24.5mm, Diameter (socket): 22.6mm, Thickness (wall, at mouth of socket):

from decorated gold sheet around a copper alloy core. The ring is oval in plan with a triangular cross-sectional profile. The face has a pronounced midrib and eight smaller concentric ribs running around either side of the face (17 ribs in total) suggesting construction from gold wire, in contrast to the gold sheeting of the inner surface and terminals which is flat and undecorated. The opening in the ring has been damaged, with the gold plate broken to reveal the corroded copper alloy core. One of the terminals has split and been pushed back inside the ring, with the sheeting ruptured; there is additional crushing damage to one side of the ring which has ruptured the sheeting on the inner surface.\n\nLength: 19.6mm; width: 17.1mm; thickness: 5.2 mm; weight: 3.66g

The ring is in the shape of an oval-sectioned loop. Many of these penannular rings have a copper alloy core wrapped in gold sheet; however, it is not entirely clear if this is the case for this example, as there are to chips or brakes showing the core.\n\nThere are many examples of these objects recorded in the PAS database. Some of these include: BH-719492 (2018 T761), PAS-011055 (2016 T920), KENT-FF00A6 (2018 T376) and HAMP-425F0D (2018 T89).\n\nThese penannular rings are sometimes known as 'ring-money' or 'hair rings' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008) {[}References from NMGW-04216C{]}. The function of these objects remain relatively unknown, having been possibly identified as currency for exchange, or ornaments worn by people to display wealth and power.

is\\&nbsp;snipped (in a pincer-like or \\&lsquo;chisel-cut\\&rsquo; way) on either end. The object has a sub-hexagonal cross-section. \n\nDimensions: Length: 18mm; Width: 6mm; Thickness: 4.5mm; Weight: 4.32g \n\nMetal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of a gold bar fragment by the British Museum, indicated a surface composition of approximately 81-83\\% gold, 14-16\\% silver, the rest being largely copper. See appended report. \n\nDiscussion: This fragment is similar in appearance \\&ndash; and, perhaps most notably, style of pincer-like cut \\&ndash; to the fragments from the Middle Bronze Age hoard from Fittleworth hoard (of 42 objects), also found in West Sussex (see Treasure Trove Reviewing Committee Annual Report 1996-1997 p.7-8, no.1, now in the British museum registration BEP 1996, 0902.1ff). In particular, comparison can be made with fragments BEP 1996, 0902.1-3. \n\nNon-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis\\&nbsp;indicated a surface composition of approximately 81-83\\% gold, 14-16\\% silver, the rest being largely copper.\\&nbsp;This\\&nbsp;composition is consistent with a Bronze Age date. \n\nConclusion: On the balance of probabilities, this object qualifies as Treasure under the Treasure Act (1996), by virtue of being of prehistoric date and comprising of more than 10\\% precious metal.

axehead, probably dating from the Early Bronze Age period (c. BC 2350 - c. BC 2050).&nbsp;\\nThe axe is broadly rectangular in plan with a slightly splayed crescentric blade. In profile and in section the object is broadly lentoid.\\nThe sides of the axe gently taper outwards with a shallow curve, from the rounded butt to the blade. The curve is less shallow towards the blade. The axehead has suffered significant loss from corrosion on all surfaces, particularly at the blade and the butt.\\nThe axehead measures 67.4 mm in length, the butt is 18.1 mm wide and the blade measures 27.3 mm wide. The butt has a thickness of 3.8 mm, the ridge measures 10.9 mm thick and the blade is 2.1 mm thick. The axehead weighs 59 g.\\n\\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).\\n\\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham&#39;s (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL.&nbsp;BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\\n\\nReference:\\n\\nNeedham, S.

Soil remains wedged between layers. The object has been folded up and consists of 5-6 layers. The tapering tip of one end of the strip is visible on the outside of the folded bundle. Lines of pointillé decoration run along both edges of the strip and meet at the terminal. There are three perforations visible on a terminal of the band that tapers inwards forming a triangle with the single perforation at the tip of the taper en\\n\\nDimensions (in folded condition):\\n\\nLength: 28.23mm\\nWidth: 19.93mm\\nThickness (with soil): 5.33mm\\n\\nThickness (sheet): 0.18mm\\nWeight (with soil): 8.55g\\n\\nMetal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of the strip (undertaken at the British Museum) indicated a surface composition of approximately 92-94% gold and 6-8% silver, the rest (less than 1%) being copper. (See appended report).\\n\\nCurators note: this is a very similar composition to the very similar band from Berinsfield, South Oxfordshire (Treasure case 2016 T521).\\n\\nDiscussion: Of Early Bronze Age date (c.2500 - 1500 BC), and now in two pieces, this is only the fifth or sixth example of this type of object from Britain. These objects are rare and are not yet fully understood; it is likely to date from the earliest Bronze Age / Chacolithic period, c. 2500-2200 BC and as such is part of a select group of objects that represent the earliest gold objects in Britain.\\n\\nThe function or what object this mount decorated is not certain; suggestions include scabbard fittings, diadem or neck choker/band, or perhaps a decorative strip attached to leather. A similar object was reported as Treasure in 2005, case number 2005T21 (from 'near Winchester' - the provenance is vague - acquired by the British Museum: 2008, 8019.1) (Needham &amp; Sheridan 2014, 908-9). The 'near Winchester' find also has three perforations set within the terminals in a similar fashion to a recently reported item from Stratford-Upon-Avon (Treasure case 2016 T209), and Berinsfield, South Oxfordshire (Treasure case 2016 T521).\n3

undeveloped, straight-sided blade that has worn to a curve on one side. From the blade the axe tapers to a narrow rounded butt end, that is 14 mm wide. The sides of the blade expand slightly and meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 27 mm. The curve of the blade suggests that it was not probably used as an axehead but instead perhaps buried as a representation of a larger functional axehead at a time when bronze was too valuable to bury. The length of the flat axe is only 76 mm so it less than half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.\\n\\nSee CORN-7ACDD7 for a similar miniature flat axehead that is dated from 2200-2000 BC.\\n\\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axehead on page 502, plate 69, no.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, which is associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.\\n\\nCowie &amp; O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin &amp; Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axehead with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.\\n\\nSchmidt &amp; Burgess (1981) illustrate similar unclassified miniature flat axeheads with worn blades in pl.22, nos.266 &amp; 283.\\n\\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\\n\\nNeedham, S.

incomplete cast copper alloy (bronze) flat axe of Early Bronze Age dating (c. 2350 BC to c. 2050 BC).\\n\\nThe flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with an incomplete rounded shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 12.0 mm (thickness: 2.4 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are relatively straight. The axe is thickest at the mid point (6.0 mm), with no sign of a proto stop ridge. The sides of the blade expand to produce a rounded blade edge with an abraded width of 34.4 mm (thickness 3.6 mm). \\n\\nThe axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\\n\\nIt measures 72.5 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 34.4 mm, width at the butt is 12.0 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 6.0 mm. It weighs 48.6 grams.\\n\\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).\\n\\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\\n\\nReference:\\n\\nNeedham, S.

alloy miniature flat axehead, ovate in plan, and slightly lozenge-shaped in profile, with an undeveloped, straight-sided blade that has worn to a curve and has a broken edge on one side. From the blade the axe tapers to a narrow rounded butt end, that is 14 mm wide. The sides of the blade do not expand but meet the curved blade edge with an abraded width of 29 mm. The curve of the blade suggests that it was not probably used as an axehead but instead perhaps buried as a representation of a larger functional axehead at a time when bronze was too valuable to bury. The length of the flat axe is only 83 mm so it less than half the size of a standard Early Bronze Age flat axe from South-west England. There is no evidence of any form of incised or cast decoration present on any surface of the axe, but much of the original surface is missing, due to corrosion and abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil. The surface is now pitted and there is active light green powdering from bronze disease within some of the pits.\\n\\nSee CORN-7ACDD7 for a similar miniature flat axehead that is dated from 2200-2000 BC.\\n\\nPearce (1983) illustrates a similar example of a slender miniature Migdale type flat axehead on page 502, plate 69, no.587, from Banner Down in Somerset, which is associated with the Migdale metalworking tradition of the Early Bronze Age, c.2200-2000 BC.\\n\\nCowie &amp; O'Connor, Some Early Bronze Age stone moulds from Scotland, in Kienlin &amp; Roberts, Metals and Societies (2009) illustrate a similar miniature flat axehead with straight sides from Broomhill, Penicuik, Midlothian, on page 325, fig.10, which is dated from the Early Bronze Age.\\n\\nSchmidt &amp; Burgess (1981) illustrate similar unclassified miniature flat axeheads with worn blades in pl.22, nos.266 &amp; 283.\\n\\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, Metalworking Stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 (c.2350-2050 cal BC). This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\n6

        Solid gold armring with punched decoration. The armring is circular in section and curves in an oval shape, with overlapping terminals. Shallow punched dots cover the outer three quarters of the object. These measure approximately 1.44mm in diameter and are tightly clustered, with some overlap. There is noticeable wear to the outer edge of the object as the surface is smoother and the punched dots are much shallower.\\n\\nLength: 82.09mm\\n\\nWidth: 68.57mm\\n\\nDiameter: 11.55mm\\n\\nWeight: 311g\\n\\n\\n\\nDiscussion:\\n\\nThe armring is similar in form to those of the Tullydonnell hoard from County Donegal, which were dated to c. 1200 - 800 BC. A direct parallel with punched decoration is known from Trimblestown Castle, County Meath, which is now in the collections of the National Museum of Ireland (Armstrong, E. C. R. (1920) Guide to the Collection of Irish Antiquities, p. 94, no. 412, pl. XVIII, no. 392). This was dated to c. 800 - 700 BC. The object is also paralleled by a larger example from The Lee, Buckinghamshire, recorded as a bracelet (Treasure Trove case no. 315 from 199/4, now in Buckinghamshire County Museum, Wendover). A small scale excavation at the findspot of the bracelet recovered no evidence of a feature or container but it was noted that the object came from the ploughsoil and may have been disturbed (Treasure Trove file, British Museum archive). Unlike the object under discussion, the punched dotted decoration on The Leeexample extended across the terminals. Similar punched decoration also appears on gold plated base metal late Bronze Age penannular rings (sometimes called bullae) of Lough Gara type (Ibid., p. 93, nos 404 - 406). Given the paucity of examples known, it is unclear whether this armring is an Irish or British type.\\n\\n\\n\\nAuthors:                                                                                                         \\n\\nLydia Prosser\\nFLO for Lancashire and Cumbria\\n\\nNeil Wilkin\\nThe British Museum\\n\\nMary Cahill​​​​​​​\\nNational Museum of Ireland Galway\n7  1. Gold penannular bar bracelet fragment - Type 4B \\n\\nDimensions: surviving length 25.7mm; bar width 5.7mm; bar thickness 4mm; head width 9.8mm; head thickness 8.3mm; weight 7.36g.\\n\\nThis is a terminal fragment of a gold bar bracelet with a D-shape section. The bar expands abruptly to a solid, outwardly expanding flat terminal, also with a D-section. On the flat terminal face there is a slight penannular shaped hollow 0.5-1.0mm wide running around the sides and outer margins of the terminal. This is inset parallel with and approximately 0.5mm from the outer edge of the terminal face. The bar has been deliberately broken pre-deposition with a 'pinched' break, suggesting it was chiselled or cut, rather than bent and snapped. There is also one chisel mark on the flat face of the bar, which is close to the break and likely represents a failed impact mark. There are numerous and pronounced dents and impressed tool marks on the surface of the bracelet, which appear to be ancient, linked either with the forming of the bracelet or representing deliberate damage to the bracelet immediately prior to burial of the hoard.\\n\\n2. Copper alloy pin head or bracelet terminal fragment\\n\\nDimensions: surviving length 20.2mm; shaft diameter (below head) 4.8 x 5.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.6 x 3.2mm; surviving head depth 11.5mm; surviving head width 10.2mm; weight 2.33g.\\n\\nThis is a fragment of a circular-section bar of bronze that expands at one end to an incomplete terminal or head. The head/terminal is concave with a convex underside and was probably originally circular. Below the head/terminal the shaft is appears to have been decorated with at least three horizontal ribs, which are now very worn and shallow, and separated by at least two shallow grooves. The shaft appears to taper slightly, but degradation to the surface makes this difficult to discern.\\n\\nFragmentation has occurred around the circumference of the head/terminal so no original edge survives, and the object has broken across the bar/shaft in prehistory. This breakage is coupled with damage to the surface of the bronze, which is consistently patinated. The object is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges.\\n\\n3. Copper alloy penannular bracelet terminal fragment (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 4)\\n\\nDimensions: surviving curved length 35.2mm; shaft diameter (at break) 3.4 x 2.7mm; surviving head diameter 9.3x8.1mm; weight 3.23g.\\n\\nThis is a fragment of a bracelet with a circular-section bar, gently expanding to a roughly oval terminal. The terminal is incomplete, and there is a prominent lateral ridge down the otherwise flat terminal. This ridge may be casting flash. The overall piece is curved, indicating it once formed part of a bracelet. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 4, below, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established, as the break points on both fragments are worn and eroded.\\n\\nThere are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, particularly around the terminal, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.\\n\\n4. Copper alloy incomplete possible bracelet (possibly once part of bracelet fragment 3)\\n\\nDimensions: bent length 45mm; maximum bar diameter 4.3x5mm; min. bar diameter 3.6x1.8mm; weight 7.6g.\\n\\nThis is a bronze bar, bent into a rough U-shape, with a rounded section, now heavily eroded so as to be inconsistent in diameter and section shape along the length. Where original surfaces survive, there is an angular, slightly projecting casting flash evident on both interior and exterior sides of the hoop. Both ends are broken, though one expands slightly, which might indicate this was approaching a terminal end. At one point, the bar has been deliberately and differentially bent out of shape, compressing the surviving ends out of shape and towards each other. At the point of bending, the bar is thin and compressed. The breakages at each end are worn and abraded. As this fragment was found associated with possible bracelet fragment No. 3, above, it is possible that these fragments were once part of the same single bracelet, although no conjoin can now be established.\\n\\nThere are small patches of an uneven brown patina surviving, but much of the original surface has delaminated, revealing green corrosion.\\n\\n5. Copper alloy socketed axe - Slender faceted axe of Type Meldreth, Variant Aylsham / Class D \\n\\nDimensions: maximum surviving length 91.2mm; maximum width cutting edge 51.1mm; external socket diameter (width x depth) 31.5 x 28.2mm; internal socket diameter (width x depth) 22.8 x 20.6mm; depth of collar 16.2mm; width of body below loop 27.2mm; depth of socket 62.6mm; weight 110.8g.\\n\\nThis is a near complete copper alloy socketed axe with an oval shaped socket mouth and a slender upper body that flares to a broad cutting edge. The body is roughly hexagonal in section, with two narrow and not particularly defined facets down each face margin. The socket mouth is flat and the collar is plain and flared. The base of the collar is defined by a prominent raised horizontal rib moulding, flanked by a shallow, poorly formed groove above and below. On the lower side, there is a second and poorly defined rib moulding, showing as a parallel raised ridge, beneath which the narrow facets originate. The rib moulding is straight on one face, but curved and irregular on the opposite face. The loop emerges below the collar and is of modest width. The faces of the axe are undecorated, with the exception of the facets, defined by grooves on each side of each face, starting from below the collar and following the shape of the axe. These grooves are shallow and poorly formed, stopping as the blade is expanding; the longest extends for 42.6mm.\\n\\nThe sides of the axe diverge greatly towards the cutting edge, creating a broad edge. The original cutting edge no longer survives and has fragmented unevenly, but was probably originally straight. One face of the axe has been worked to approximately 4.5mm above the surviving edge, though the opposite face shows limited signs of preparation. The blade appears to have been hammered out on the worked face, so the shape of the lower blade is asymmetrical; one half is almost crinoline in form, while the other simply flares out. This could be the result of hammering or a fault in the mould. There are numerous short horizontal striation marks across the worked face of the lower blade, which likely relate to sharpening or working activities, and in sections there are also vertical striations. The opposite face has a few macroscopic horizontal striations.\\n\\nThe molten bronze appears to have been cast in around the interior of the socket mouth, with two slightly raised lumps on the mouth identifiable as possible runner stumps. The casting seams down either side of the axe survive as raised, blunt ridges, but seem to have been hammered down. The slightly off-centre line of these seams indicates the axe was cast in slightly mismatched mould halves. On the no-loop side, there is a linear groove running beside the casting seam, suggesting an imperfection in the shaping of the mould. There are also three holes in the upper body and collar of the axe, which are casting defects where the metal has not filled the mould completely. An oval hole (7.7 x 5.4mm) is present in the flared section of the collar on the opposite side of the axe to the side loop. On the opposite face of the axe are two linearly aligned oval holes, one in the gap by the loop (c.4.5 x 7.7mm), and one about 5mm above it (4.1 x 6mm).\\n\\nThe axe is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, mottled with tan and orange patches. The socket mouth has suffered some minor material loss, which shows a small patch of green corrosion product forming, as does the fragmentary cutting edge.\\n\\n6. 7. and 8. Copper alloy socketed axe fragments - Type Croxton (conjoining fragments)\\n\\nDimensions: surviving length of No.6 54.9mm; surviving length of No.7 42.3mm; surviving length of No.8 24.8mm; external socket width 48.5mm; internal socket width 38.5mm; maximum collar depth 12.7mm; width of body below loop 38.2mm; width of No.7 18.8mm; width of No.8 24.4mm; weight No.6 76.7g; weight No.7 11.3g; weight No.8 9.2g; combined weight 97.1g.\\n\\nThese are three refitting fragments of an incomplete upper body of a ribbed socketed axe. The larger fragment (No.6) consists of one face of the upper body of a socketed axe, including the socket and collar, side loop, and upper part of the body bearing three vertical ribs. The second fragment (No.7) is much smaller and refits on the non-loop side, bearing part of the opposite face with two of the three ribs. The third fragment (No.8) is a small part of the socket mouth and moulding on the loop side, that forms an imperfect but probable refit with No. 6 and with very closely similar characteristics (e.g. the form and width of the collar, the same patina and unworn break edges), so that it can be concluded it was once part of the same axe. The area of refit between Nos. 6 and 8 indicates that there was some material loss during the breakage (e.g. a small section of metal) which would explain why these two fragments do not refit perfectly. The axe has split vertically down the socket, as well as across the body about 16.4mm below the side loop. \\n\\nThe socket end (visible on fragments 6 &amp; 8) is defined by a flat-topped mouth, with a wide and plain onset collar with straight and slightly everted sides. Three parallel lateral raised ribs extend from the base of the collar (fragment 6) and terminate below the point of breakage, though do not converge. Two of these have worn down or damaged. The surviving socket indicates it was originally sub-rectangular with rounded corners and the body was broadly hexagonal, with angular face edges. A narrow loop descends from the base of the collar, with the external casting seam on the loop placed off centre. Prominent raised casting seams are present on both sides of the axe fragment, though are blunt, suggesting they have been hammered down.\\n\\nFragment No.7 represents the corner of the upper body of the axe and part of the face with two lateral raised ribs. Fragment No.8 represents the corner of a flat-topped socket mouth,\\n\\nwith a deep onset collar moulding of identical proportions to No.6. The possible remains of a worn runner stump are visible on the mouth of fragment No. 8. This fragment has broken unevenly along three sides.\\n\\nAll fragments are largely covered in a dark brown patina, but this has delaminated in patches around the socket collar and along the ribs, leaving tan and pale green corrosion. All of the breakages along the sides, socket and body are soil covered, but not significantly eroded and retaining localised angularities along the breaks, suggesting that the breaks occurred while buried, rather than during retrieval.\\n\\n9. Probable small face wall fragment of a ribbed socketed axe (probably part of Croxton Type socketed axe No. 6-8)\\n\\nDimensions: length 16.1mm; width 9.0mm; thickness 2.1mm; weight 1.27g.\\n\\nThis is a small, thin fragment of bronze, broken along all edges in antiquity. On one face, adjacent to a break line, there is a straight linear ridge, consistent with a decorative rib from the face of a ribbed socketed axe. The wall thickness of 2.1mm evident on this fragment is also consistent with the range of wall thicknesses seen on bronze socketed axes. One corner of this bronze fragment has been distorted, suggesting impact damage at some point, either in antiquity or more recent times.\\n\\nThere is a small patch of dark brown patina surviving on both faces at one end, though the original surface has delaminated from the rest of the object revealing pale green corrosion.\\n\\n10. Copper alloy spearhead fragment - probably Group 11\\n\\nDimensions: surviving length 47.7mm; width at breakage 22.3mm; depth at breakage (across midrib) 7mm; thickness at tip 6.2mm; weight 14.5g.\\n\\nThis is a tip fragment of a socketed spearhead, broken unevenly in antiquity. It has a low, rounded midrib, and thick narrow blade wings, creating a pointed ovate section. The edge is abraded, making it difficult to determine the original form of the blade, but the slender nature of the tip indicates it may have been flame-shaped. The surviving tip is thick and blunt.\\n\\nThe spearhead seems to have broken pre-deposition across the upper blade, below the internal socket aperture. There is still material embedded in the socket, making it unclear how much further the socket extends. The break is uneven as one blade wing survives more than the other.\\n\\nThe fragment is largely covered in an even dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, particularly on the midrib, revealing green corrosion.\\n\\n11. Copper alloy blade fragment - probable sword\\n\\nDimensions: surviving length 76.7mm; width at breaks 19.6 and 28.7mm; thickness at breaks 5.6 and 7.5mm; weight 66.3g.\\n\\nThis is a narrow fragment of a blade, broken at both ends. The blade tapers to one end, suggesting it is from the lower blade, towards the tip. It has a curved midrib, creating a biconvex section. The blade edges are abraded and there are no signs of bevels.\\n\\nThe breaks are consistently patinated and rough, suggesting the breakages occurred shortly before deposition. The breaks have occurred largely straight across the blade and show no signs of casting flaws, inclusions or porosity. The narrower end has a very slight transverse bend (c.3/4 degrees) associated with the break, though there are no other associated marks.\\n\\nThe fragment is largely covered in an uneven dark brown patina, with patches of surface delamination, revealing pale brown degradation.\\n\\n12. Copper alloy casting jet - four runner form\\n\\nDimensions: top surface length 43.8mm; top surface width 21.4mm; maximum height 32.8mm; depth of pouring reservoir 17.5mm; weight 74.7g.\\n\\nThis is an oval-shaped jet with four runners, offset from the centre of the pouring reservoir. The reservoir is quite deep and has a rough, uneven upper surface. The underside of one end tapers in with straight sides towards the runners, while the other has more upright and straight sides leading down, shaped by the top of the mould. There is also a small bronze protrusion at the tapering end of the reservoir, while four runners extend from the base. These runners occur as two sets of two. Two are short (c.11mm) and rounded, with a slight split between them. The second pair are longer (17.7mm) and flatter, diverging more greatly, tapering from thick, broad protrusions to narrow stumps.\\n\\nThe jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.\\n\\n13. Copper alloy casting jet - two runner form\\n\\nDimensions: top surface length 27.7mm; top surface width 21mm; maximum height 32.9mm; depth of pouring reservoir 14.1mm; weight 53.5g. \\n\\nThis a semi-rectangular shaped jet in plan with two runners. The upper surface, of rectangular shape, is straight at the short ends, but tapers slightly in along the longer sides, shaped by the top of the mould. One runner is shorter (7.8mm) with an oval-section. The other runner is broad (17.3mm) and long (19mm) with a D-shaped section.\\n\\nThe jet is covered in an uneven brown patina that is delaminated in patches, particularly around the edges, revealing green corrosion.\\n\\n14. Copper alloy annular ring\\n\\nDimensions: external diameter 30 x 29.1mm; internal diameter 22 x 22.4mm; bar diameter 3.8 - 4.0mm; weight 4.8g.\\n\\nThis is a complete circular, annular bronze ring with a circular section.\\n\\nThe ring is largely covered in a dark brown patina, but the surface has delaminated in patches revealing pale green corrosion.\\n\\n15. Copper alloy complex circular object - possible vehicle wheel axle fitting or turning cap\\n\\nDimensions: diameter 52.3mm; height 30mm; height of cylinder c.21mm; internal diameter 25mm; thickness (of base) 9mm; weight 123.7g.\\n\\nThis is a cast, circular and hollow cylindrical object with a thick outer face and a circular perforation through the centre, with an inset projecting cylinder on the inner face. The margins of the disc, around both external diameter and internal perforation are bevelled, to give a presentable finish. The outer face is thick, heavy and wide, while the walls of the narrower internal cylinder are thinner. Part of the cylinder has broken away on one side. The cylinder tapers in at the centre of the body, before expanding again to a biconical moulding. There is a cast oval perforation through the narrow cylinder wall, while there is an aligning and corresponding curved groove across the underside of the outer disc. This appears to have once held a pin in place, to attach the casting to a larger composite object. The underside surface of the outer disc has diagonally aligned and parallel file or tool marks adjacent to the outer margins, while towards the interior the surface is covered with concentric linear striations, hinting at modern machine finishing.\\n\\nThe object is covered in a dark green patina.\\n\\nThis object was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as superficially reminiscent of known chariot or cart fittings of Late Bronze Age and Iron Age date. \\n\\n16. Copper alloy casting waste - possibly slag\\n\\nDimensions: length 34.2mm; width 29.0mm; maximum thickness 17.0mm; min thickness 3.0mm; weight 15.4g.\\n\\nThis is a small, rough piece of casting waste, probably slag, with an uneven surface, caused by the cooling of the metal. The piece is irregularly-shaped and thicker at one end than the other.\\n\\nThis piece is covered in green corrosion.\\n\\nThis slag fragment was included in the report and for analysis (see below) as a precautionary measure, as consistent in general characteristics with bronze slag and casting waste associated elsewhere with Late Bronze Age hoards. \n8

flat axe is broadly sub rectangular in shape with a splayed crescent shaped blade. In profile it is broadly lentoid, with slight tapering edges. The butt is relatively thin having a narrow rounded profile; the width at the butt is 17.1 mm (thickness: 2.0 mm). The sides of the axe gently expand in width from the butt to the blade; in shape they are gently curved. The axe is thickest at the mid point (8.6 mm), with no traces of a proto stop ridge present. Potential decoration is present on one side as four circular depressions around the mid point. The sides of the blade expand to produce a crescentic blade edge with an abraded width of 34.3 mm (2.6 mm thick). The tips of the crescent shaped blade have been damaged through either abrasion or wear, as has the blade edge itself. \\n\\nIt measures 80.7 mm in length, maximum width at the blade is 34.3 mm, width at the butt is 17.1 mm and it has a maximum thickness of 8.6 mm. It weighs 77.7 grams.\\n\\nThe axe is a mid to dark green colour, with an uneven surface patina. Abrasion, caused by movement whilst within the ploughsoil, has resulted in a loss of some of the original surface detail.\\n\\nThe axehead is best described as coming from the first phases of the Early Bronze Age and is comparable to (although not containing all the attributes of Migdale axes (many of these tend to have narrower butts which flare at the cutting edge).\\n\\nThese axes all fit within the earliest phases of metal working in Britain, metalworking stage II, which corresponds to Needham's (1996) Period 2 circa 2350- 2050 CAL. BC. This means that they are dated, broadly, to the same period as Beaker pottery, barbed and tanged flint arrowheads, copper halberds and gold lunulae.\\n\\nReference:\\n\\nNeedham, S.

dating to the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1300-1100&nbsp;BC). The fragment is a small section of the four-flanged twisted bar that is cruciform or &#39;+&#39; shaped in cross-section. It is broken at both ends.\\n\\n\\n\\nMeasurements: The fragment measures 19.2mm in length, a maximum of 8.9mm wide, 8.2mm thick and weighs 3.31 grams.\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion:&nbsp; Made of gold and of Bronze Age date, the fragment is evidently of a precious metal and over 300 years old, and therefore constitutes treasure under the Treasure Act (1996). \n10

                Description:\\n\\nA folded fragment of a gold strip or ribbon possibly dating to the Middle to Late Bronze Age c. 1500 - 800 BC.  The ribbon is sub-rectangular in plan and made from a sheet of gold. One side of the ribbon is decorated with eight regular, longitudinal, incised grooves. The other side of the ribbon is plain with some light scratches. The ribbon is folded almost half-way down to face the reverse side and folds again at the terminal which has rough damaged edges. The damage is not new. The other end has a neat, flat-ended terminal with sharp 90 degree corners. There is a circular perforation at this end of the ribbon on the fourth and fifth ridge which is slightly off-centre. The diameter of the perforation is 1.1mm. There is an indentation on one edge of the ribbon by the terminal. On the decorated side of the ribbon, the perforation is surrounded by a lip and on the back of the ribbon it is surrounded by a shallow recess indicating that the perforation was punched through from the reverse side. The opposing end of the ribbon is also square-shaped but the edge has been bent over back to rest toward the perforated side of the ribbon. It is a little rough around the edges. There are also some longitudinal scratches and scuff marks on this plain side of the ribbon.\\n\\nDimensions:\\n\\nLength: 17.8mm\\n\\nWidth: 6.6mm\\n\\nThickness: 3.93\\n\\nWeight: 1.3g.\\n\\nDiscussion: \\n\\nA similar grooved, pierced gold ribbon is recorded under Treasure number 2012 T577 (ESS-C13B97), and other similar types of ribbons include: 2013 T326 (WILT-26F931), 2007 T692 (WAW-C0C0B3), 2014 T63 (BERK-387817), and 2013 T154 (PAS-067AC5).\\n\\nThe incised linear decoration of the strip can be paralleled on a number of gold strips and 'ribbons' of known and very probable Bronze Age date, particularly the find from Sherborne St John, Hampshire (2013 T154), which also had a single perforation to one and was decorated on only one side. The dimensions and weights of the bands are also comparable. The Tendering strip also bears comparison with gold strips from The Hamel, Oxfordshire (Case 1981; Palmer 1981); Corringham, Lincolnshire (2011 T459); Sproxton, North Yorkshire (2010 T664); Flixton, North Yorkshire (2003 T40a&amp;b); and Ansley, Warwickshire (2007 T672). The find from The Hamel, Oxfordshire, came from the same layer as typologically late Beaker pottery dating to the Early Bronze Age (cf. Needham 2005).\\n\\nConclusion: Due to the precious metal content of this object being over 10% gold, and it being over 300 years old, this object qualifies as Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.\n11

This item, possibly hair ornaments or ear rings, has been cut from thin gold sheet and would normally have been wrapped into a cylindrical 'basket' shape. This example has been flattened out and shows the full extent of the oval plate which is 38mm long and 16mm wide with semi-circular ends and long straight sides. The interior of the plate is decorated with two concentric lines that run around the outside, inside of this are four zones of about five to six vertical lines running perpendicular to the long edges. This plate is heavily damaged with extensive creasing at either end, plus an off centre crease that runs the length of the plate. Protruding for the centre of one of the long edges is a long and thin (21mm long, 2.5mm wide) tang that would have ultimately been wrapped around the rolled cylindrical plate. As with the plate the tang is heavily creased.\\n\\nAn almost exact parallel was found in South Oxfordshire 2012 T774 BERK-0D1A05, but also see BERK-F548E6, SUSS-096CEB, LON-FF7E65 and BH-956274\\n\\nThis class of object belongs to the earliest phases of metallurgy in Britain. These are usually associated with burials and a very rare, dating to the earliest phase of the Bronze Age, c. 2400-2200 BC. Such objects are variously referred to as 'basket ornaments' or 'basket earrings', or 'hair rings'. They are in any case personal ornaments, and have been found in pairs in graves dating to the early Beaker period. Whether worn on hair, ears or items of costume, they were rolled into a basket shape in use.\\n\\nIn shape and decoration this example falls into Needham's Atlantic Group B (ii) (Needham 2011). Closely similar ornaments were found in Beaker burials at Chilbolton, Hants and Radley 4a, Oxfordshire (Kinnes 1994).\n13

itself longitudinally, with breaks at either end. The torc has a cruciform (x-shaped) cross-section with four flanges, although they twist in such a way as to give a circular cross-section around the flanges. The breaks are quite sharp, suggesting they could be quite recent. The bend is not quite at the centre of the object.\\nThe ends, both slightly squashed, measure 8.2x6.2mm and 8.4x7.3mm. At these breaks the flanges are c.0.6-0.8mm thick, with a thickened rim (slightly flattened to the outside surface) 0.9-1.0mm thick. At the deepest, the depth between the flanges is c.2.5mm deep. The width/ diameter of the object is relatively parallel and c.9mm.\\nThe fragment measures 41.6mm in bent length (unbent it would be c.75mm), 26.8mm in max width and 8.9mm in max.thickness. It weighs 18.24g.\n14

Description: A Middle Bronze Age gold composite penannular ring, possibly incomplete, probably dating to c. 1300-1150 BC. The object consists of two concavo-convex bands of gold sheet which appear to have been soldered together and curved around to form a loop, the latter left open.\\n\\nDimensions: diameter 13.9mm; width 7.9mm; thickness 2.3mm; weight 3.26g.\\n\\nDiscussion: Comparison to other artefacts of the same type would suggest that the present artefact formed the outer cover for a base metal or organic core, along with an inner gold sheet, cf. YORYM-06C5C1, BERK-E2ED60, NMS-ACBFA4 on the PAS database.  \\n\\nThe penannular ring appears to consist of over 10% precious metal and to be over 300 years old at the time of finding and as such qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.\\n\\nWil Partridge\\nFinds Liaison Officer for Wiltshire\\nMarch 2019\n15

European, Bronze Age, type, c.1100-800 BC. It is made from a single length of 2.7mm diameter, copper alloy wire, one end of which is a tightly wound to form a six turn spiral. From this the wire is bent back on itself to form a hook-like catch plate. The wire is twisted back and forth to form five, figure of 8 loops on the end of which is an integral pin. The wire is cracked at this point. The brooch is in excellent condition with a mid-brown patination which contains some grains of sand. Length 99.3mm, Width 41.7mm, Height 26.2mm, Mass 30.31g.\\n\\nThis brooch is of Central European type and can be closely paralleled by two examples found in a hoard of gold jewellery on the bank of the Danube between Duna-Földvár and Paks in Hungary. This was dated to the 11th to 9th century BC (Hugh Tait, 7000 years of Jewellery, The British Museum, 2006, 51, plate 108). A further parallel is provided by an example in Merseyside Museums which is provenance as 'Northern Hungary' (Susan Nicholson, Catalogue of the Prehistoric Metalwork in the Merseyside County Museums, Merseyside County Council, Liverpool,, 1980, 70, No. 141.\\n\\nWhile it is not impossible for this object to have found its way to England in antiquity its condition, and the fact that it was a surface find, suggest that it may be a recent import, perhaps coming from a European collection during the Second World War and, its significance unrecognised, subsequently lost.\n16

Cast pentagonal-section strip, broken at one end and flattened to spatulate form at the other. The section is angular, with two low and probably worn facets on what is taken to have been the display or outer face, producing a gently keeled appearance. This is carried along the object to the spatulate end, which may therefore be regarded as a deliberately fashioned terminal to a penannular and probably symmetrical form, with its equivalent now lost. The object is now curved with two sharper and one more gentle bends, with two cracks near the latter. The finder kindly notes that the curved parts near the flat terminal and towards the other end of the object both fit snugly against the wrist if the keeled face is set outwards, though of course the object may as easily be worn around the neck. The finder also notes the object has been tested - presumably non-destructively - and its material confirmed as 'pure gold'. Extensive search around the find spot has yet to reveal the missing fragment. Suggested date: Late Bronze Age, 1000-800 BC\\n\\nGiven its age and material the object is to be subjected to the Treasure process, Ref. 2019 T188. Its association with other Bronze Age finds reported from the vicinity also commends it as a 'find of note'.\\n\\nLength: 127mm, Width: 18.4mm, Thickness: 3.4mm, Weight: 48.58gms\n17

Cast pegged and socketed spearhead, retaining the end of a wooden shaft within, which is now pale brown in colour and fibrous in its appearance. The spearhead takes the form of a regular cone with opposed flanges forming blades which extend from the pointed tip for 71mm, or to 21mm above the mouth of the socket. Opposed drilled holes are set 9.4mm, or half way between socket and flanges, and are aligned with them. One of these holes is of 4mm diameter; the other retains the burred head of a rivet of diameter 4.4mm. Three finely incised circumferential lines immediately below them may have served to set out the holes. Above them, a zig-zag pattern of elongated dots - or perhaps dashes given the form - produces a series of six triangles between the rivet holes and a seventh carried over the occupied hole, with each triangle of height 4mm. A further two circumferential lines of dots are carried around the socket mouth below the triplicated continuous lines.\\n\\nThe outer cutting edges of the blades are lightly abraded, showing a green tint against an overall brown patina, and along with limited abrasions on one side of the object these are the only indications of deterioration or damage. As with other objects of the period hereabouts, the spearhead appears to have been deposited in working order. The practice of ritual 'killing' of an object does not seem to figure here.\\n\\nThe triplicate decoration combined with zig-zag motifs recurs in WAW-C65A09, a spearhead recently reported from Warwickshire. That example is held to be of later Bronze Age date, 1150-600 BC. In this case, the relative proportions of blade and socket are different, with more blade and less socket. A stubby peg-hole spearhead from Burton on Stather, North Lincolnshire, displayed in the North Lincolnshire Museum, more closely resembles this example, and is ascribed to the Early Bronze Age, probably c.1600BC or thereafter.\\n\\nSuggested date: Middle to Late Bronze age, 1600-800 BC\\n\\nLength: 94mm, Width (at blade): 24.5mm, Diameter (socket): 22.6mm, Thickness (wall, at mouth of

The ring is oval in plan with a triangular cross-sectional profile. The face has a pronounced midrib and eight smaller concentric ribs running around either side of the face (17 ribs in total) suggesting construction from gold wire, in contrast to the gold sheeting of the inner surface and terminals which is flat and undecorated. The opening in the ring has been damaged, with the gold plate broken to reveal the corroded copper alloy core. One of the terminals has split and been pushed back inside the ring, with the sheeting ruptured; there is additional crushing damage to one side of the ring which has ruptured the sheeting on the inner surface.\\n\\nLength: 19.6mm; width: 17.1mm; thickness: 5.2 mm; weight: 3.66g\n19

The ring is in the shape of an oval-sectioned loop. Many of these penannular rings have a copper alloy core wrapped in gold sheet; however, it is not entirely clear if this is the case for this example, as there are to chips or brakes showing the core.\\n\\nThere are many examples of these objects recorded in the PAS database. Some of these include: BH-719492 (2018 T761), PAS-011055 (2016 T920), KENT-FF00A6 (2018 T376) and HAMP-425F0D (2018 T89).\\n\\nThese penannular rings are sometimes known as 'ring-money' or 'hair rings' (Taylor 1980; Green 1988; Eogan 1994; 1997; Varndell 2001; Hobbs 2003; Meeks et al 2008; O'Connor et al 2008) [References from NMGW-04216C]. The function of these objects remain relatively unknown, having been possibly identified as currency for exchange, or ornaments worn by people to display wealth and power.\n20

                                     A single fragment of gold &lsquo;bar&rsquo; of probable prehistoric date.\\n\\nDescription: It is&nbsp;snipped (in a pincer-like or &lsquo;chisel-cut&rsquo; way) on either end. The object has a sub-hexagonal cross-section. \\n\\nDimensions: Length: 18mm; Width: 6mm; Thickness: 4.5mm; Weight: 4.32g \\n\\nMetal composition: Non-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis of a gold bar fragment by the British Museum, indicated a surface composition of approximately 81-83% gold, 14-16% silver, the rest being largely copper. See appended report. \\n\\nDiscussion: This fragment is similar in appearance &ndash; and, perhaps most notably, style of pincer-like cut &ndash; to the fragments from the Middle Bronze Age hoard from Fittleworth hoard (of 42 objects), also found in West Sussex (see Treasure Trove Reviewing Committee Annual Report 1996-1997 p.7-8, no.1, now in the British museum registration BEP 1996, 0902.1ff). In particular, comparison can be made with fragments BEP 1996, 0902.1-3. \\n\\nNon-destructive X-ray fluorescence analysis&nbsp;indicated a surface composition of approximately 81-83% gold, 14-16% silver, the rest being largely copper.&nbsp;This&nbsp;composition is consistent with a Bronze Age date. \\n\\nConclusion: On the balance of probabilities, this object qualifies as Treasure under the Treasure Act (1996), by virtue of being of prehistoric date and comprising of more than 10% precious metal. \n                 classification periodFrom periodTo fromdate todate workflow\n1  Migdale type, Biggar variant         13       13    -2350  -2050        4\n2                          <NA>         13       13    -2500  -1500        4\n3                          <NA>         13       13    -2200  -2000        4\n4  Migdale type.

including a gold bangle or torc, and axe heads of Early, Middle and Late Bronze age form, reported from the vicinity. Like this spearhead, all of these objects except the mangled bangle were found in 'working order'. The individual deposits would appear to have been deliberate rather than casual losses. This pattern of deposition may follow the model of a 'persistent place' as advanced by Dr Adam Daubney with reference to Lincolnshire, an observation kindly offered by Dr Kevin Leahy. However, with objects so far dated to between the Early Bronze Age (2350-1600BC) and the Late Bronze Age (1000-800 BC), it would imply this to be a cultic centre of greater longevity than any Christian holy place in Britain. The model may also cut across those interpretations associating Later Bronze Age metalwork deposits with the margins of encroaching wetlands in periods of climatic change.\n18

                    These types of gold or gold-on-base-metal rings and penannular rings are characteristic finds of the Late Bronze Age (1150-800 BC). They belong to a class of artefact which has been termed 'hair-rings', 'ring-money' or 'lock-rings' but whose function remains uncertain. They may have been personal adornments worn on the ears or nose, rather than items of exchange. A closely similar example in size and construction in the British Museum's Greenwell Collection (WG 20) was found at Cheeseburn Grange, Northumberland.\\n\\nFor comparable examples on the database which have been declared Treasure, see SOM-50218D, ESS-5ECCA2 (2016T592), BERK-4A433E (2016T106) and BH-8DC056 (2009T513).\\n\\nConclusion: The item comprises more than 10% precious metal and is dated at over 300 years old at the time of finding. Additionally it is of prehistoric date and contains a proportion of precious metal. On both counts it therefore qualifies as potential Treasure under the stipulations of the Treasure Act 1996.\n19
